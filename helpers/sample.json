We&#8217;ve been close and hanging out ever since then really. We broke up a number of times but always got back together. The most dramatic of times were when I lost my paramedic job due to not wanting to give the vaccines then stopped attending the religious events. She thought I was being led astray and I really thought that we were going to break up about these differences. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: blue;\">I&#8217;d try to explain the things about the Word of God to her and we&#8217;d just end up arguing and getting no where.

Erica eventually remarked that I was impatient and ungraceful concerning the things of God with her where as I was seemingly much easier to deal with with everyone else. Things somehow smoothed out between us. Erica had stopped going to the church for about 6 months but said she would still listen to the sermon once in a while. She has come to acknowledge that there are many false things happening in the churches but hasn&#8217;t seemed to yet grasp how bad it really is.</span></p>\n<p>Tell me more of Erica. I see 2022 as a pivotal year. The thought comes to me that you could wait a while, perhaps a year, but for all I know, God is providing you her as a helpmate in these trying times.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: blue;\">Erica is a very quiet and simple person. She&#8217;s not one to get into big debates with people and in general is very content with just being left alone to herself. She grew up in Congo. Her dad seems to be a very wealthy business man and her mom is a zealous religious person. She likes to cook. She&#8217;s very good cook. She&#8217;s a teacher&#8217;s aide and she works at the day care. Both these jobs are Mon-Fri. She has a good work ethic. She watches a lot of tv and movies. She knows some of the Scriptures but isn&#8217;t very studious. Overall, I like having her company. She&#8217;s not needy or demanding. She doesn&#8217;t try to force her will upon me either.</span></p>\n<p>What do your parents have to say about it, not that what they feel or think necessarily counts? But I believe they care for you and it might be wise to consider their perspective.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: blue;\">My dad has always supported me in any and all relationships that I was in. He says he will support me in what I do. My parents both seem to really like her. My mom would love it if I got married and had kids with her. My family is very supportive of the relationship. My 3 brothers and my sister (and their partners and kids) all seem to like Erica.</span></p>\n<p>Coming right down to it, what does the Lord say? Isn’t that what we all need to know? I don’t know but I’m confident He’ll make known His will when it’s time.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: blue;\">I just I&#8217;ll just have to wait to hear from Him. Patience doesn&#8217;t always come easily for me. I&#8217;m not sure if I ever told you this dream or not but here goes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: blue;\">Prior to meeting Erica, I had prayed to God asking Him and telling Him (kind of sounds funny to even write that) that I wanted a wife that fears Him. I didn&#8217;t ask for anything else. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: blue;\">I met Erica and I liked her. I was also very attracted to her and still am. I was constantly asking God if she is the woman that I am to marry. I probably asked every day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: blue;\">I had a very remarkable dream one night. I was walking with Erica and I saw at a distance a man sitting at the foot of a hospital bed. He was black and he had a bible with him and in the dream I knew that he was a sincere and true man of God. He was ministering to my friend (at the time, we had a falling out) who was lying in the hospital bed with his leg in a cast and his leg was elevated. **I had found out later on that my friend actually was in the hospital that day that I had that dream for his knee problem.** As we (Erica and I) walked towards the bed, he got up and started to walk towards us. I don&#8217;t remember how exactly he said it but I was made to believe he was going to tell me who I was to marry. In my head, I thought: &#8220;Please be Erica, please be Erica.&#8221; The man told me that I had already met the one I am to marry (he didn&#8217;t say it was Erica). He laid his hands on me and told me to &#8220;be in peace&#8221; or something very similar. In the dream, my feet lifted off of the ground and my body turned horizontal in the air and peace did come upon me. I do remember feeling very peaceful in the morning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: blue;\">That was probably about a couple months after I had met her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: blue;\">I do know that I need to know from the Lord. I used to feel that God would show and reveal many things to me. Often times, in the night I would get an answer to the questions I would ask Him. I haven&#8217;t seemed to hear or be led like it used be. I wonder and have wondered why exactly that is. When I don&#8217;t hear from the Lord, it doesn&#8217;t seem like there&#8217;s anything I can do except wait longer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: blue;\">I do thank you for taking the time to read and respond to my email.</span></p>\n<p><strong>On Mar 5, 2022, at 11:43 PM, Victor Hafichuk wrote:</strong></p>\n<p>Carl, is Erica black?</p>\n<p><strong>From:</strong> Carl<br />\n<strong>Sent:</strong> March 6, 2022 7:06 AM<br />\n<strong>To:</strong> Victor Hafichuk<br />\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Marriage</p>\n<p>Yes, she’s black.<br />\nSent from my iPhone</p>\n<p><strong>From:</strong> Victor Hafichuk<br />\n<strong>Sent:</strong> March 6, 2022 8:31 PM<br />\n<strong>To:</strong> Carl<br />\n<strong>Subject:</strong> RE: Marriage</p>\n<p>Carl, you wrote:</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #500050;\">“</span><strong style=\"color: blue;\">We broke up a number of times but always got back together.</strong><span style=\"color: blue;\"> The most dramatic of times were when I lost my paramedic job due to not wanting to give the vaccines then stopped attending the religious events.

There won’t be any breaks in a marriage but the marriage itself breaks because God’s blessing is not in it.</p>\n<p>Consider these Scriptures:</p>\n<p>Proverbs 19:14<br />\n“House and wealth are inherited from fathers,<br />\nbut a prudent wife is from the Lord.”</p>\n<p>Proverbs 18:22 English Standard Version<br />\n“He who finds a wife finds a good thing<br />\nand obtains favor from the Lord.”</p>\n<p>A good wife is a gift from the Lord. Was Erica presented to you as a precious gift? Not from what you tell me. Imagine you giving someone something that comes with such strife, lack of meeting of minds, and dissension.</p>\n<p>Proverbs 10:22 English Standard Version<br />\nThe blessing of the Lord makes rich,<br />\nand He adds no sorrow with it.</p>\n<p>This is not putting Erica down. Before God, we’ve all been guilty; however, I am speaking the Lord’s Law and principles, His ordinances and precepts. As I’ve said, the Bible has all the answers for all occasions.</p>\n<p>Carl, more to bring forth concerning this situation is the fact that Erica is of another race. Am I being “racist” as modern leftist, “progressive” social engineering has wrought in this generation and as they would accuse me of? NO. I love blacks, browns, reds, yellows, and others, as well. Just as there are “good” and “bad” whites in my sight, there are “good” and “bad” blacks. Some “bad” whites are worse than some “bad” blacks and some “good” blacks are better than some “good” whites, and vice versa all the way.</p>\n<p>I love the diversity all the way. I see it as God’s way. I don’t see it as God’s way to cross, eliminate, or pollute blacks with whites and whites with blacks.</p>\n<p>You may ask, “So, why do we do it? Is it wrong seeing we can do it? Why would God allow it?”</p>\n<p>I can reply with “Why does God allow us to do any kind of evil and suffer consequences for it in anything?”</p>\n<p>You can also ask, “What do you do with the people who are mixed racially?” I’d say whatever God requires.</p>\n<p>“Oh, what a tangled web we weave when we first set out to deceive.”</p>\n<p>That goes for defiling anything God has made, doesn’t it? As I see it, God is not pleased with mixture, a principle so strongly advocated in Scripture, like, for example, the admonition to not yoke an ox with an ass. They do not pull together equally and efficiently.</p>\n<p>In what way is one superior or inferior to the other just because they’re different? They each have their purposes. Oxen are made for heavy pulling but you can’t ride an ox as well as you can ride an ass, donkey, or mule. According to the Lord, you can eat an ox, too, but you ought not to eat a donkey, even though technically you can.</p>\n<p>Or take mixing grains in a field. Imagine the mess one makes. How do you harvest, when do you harvest, how do you separate the harvest for special uses each grain affords?</p>\n<p>God has these lessons not only for the sakes of these beasts and plants but also for us. We need to take heed.</p>\n<p>But right now, it’s not about good and bad. I’m only inadequately describing to you my stance on “racism.” Racism is thinking one race to be better or worse under their Maker than another. “Racism” is a purposely divisive social doctrine framed to divide.</p>\n<p>Racism is ill will, of prejudice, as being respecters of persons, as I understand how people of the world frame it. I’m not there. Being a servant of God and knowing His will and ways, I know better and refuse to sin, by God’s grace.</p>\n<p>As with all things, everything and everyone has their place. It’s not a matter of quality but of position and purpose as God has created all things in His wisdom, just like man and woman, and nature of things everywhere.</p>\n<p>Godly reason brings me to understand God’s principles, guidelines, warnings, and His promises.</p>\n<p>Where exactly do we draw the line with races in these “rainbow” days of the end of this corrupt age? I’m not quite sure. All I know is that God will faithfully reveal that line as it applies from occasion to occasion. That line will always be a justly designed one for all concerned.</p>\n<p>A simple question, for which I expect many may have an answer, though without substantial Biblical evidence, good reason, substance, or explanation:</p>\n<p>If God determined to put races together willy-nilly in one big melting pot, then why did He make them in the first place as He did, separate, unique, and special in their ways?</p>\n<p>I can also make known to you that I’ve experienced a marital racial incident or two that did not go well at all. I can’t honestly say the consequences were a result of racial difference alone or among other causes. I can only say that racial difference was present, which I was at least hesitant about at best, and not in favor of at worst.</p>\n<p>Again, it had nothing to do with racial preference or a sense of superiority or inferiority that I’m aware of. It was a matter of fit, nature, position, purpose, and right and wrong.</p>\n<p>Carl, my love under God is no less in nature for Erica than for you because it’s God’s love for both of you. I hope you’ll both understand that. God grant you both do.</p>\n<p>Rather than as man and wife, see one another as brother and sister in Christ, and act accordingly. If both your hearts are for the Lord, it will go well and you’ll be thankful and rejoice in the Lord’s Judgment and Purposeful Counsel.</p>\n<p>Should I be wrong, may God correct me for all our sakes. I don’t believe at all that I’m wrong and stand to take responsibility before God in this matter. The Lord is giving you instruction by me for you and all concerned.</p>\n<p>\\/</p>\n<p><strong>On Mar 7, 2022, at 7:24 PM, Victor Hafichuk wrote:</strong></p>\n<p>Hi, Carl!</p>\n<p>In case you wonder, I’ve taken a bit of trouble in reply to you to form a paper that could help others in these matters of marriage judgment, with race included.

Why do you think it says death and hell are thrown into the lake of fire? What does fire do but burns continually, and it's not fire but actually liquid molten sulfur continually burning and it is true that the flesh continually comes back because that's the working of the tree of life except when those are in hell there will be continual torment.  And the bible does say that.\r\n\r\nYes once in hell the judgement is set, there's no return from hell because we can never ever righteous except for God in us therefore no amount of judgement upon those in hell can ever make them righteous so therefore the torment will continue for ever.

Par la grâce et la puissance de Dieu, toutes choses sont possibles.</p>\n<p>2267. Ce qui fut ne sera plus jamais et ce qui sera maintenant n’a jamais été.</p>\n<p>2268. Si vous essayez de faire une chose qui a de la valeur, c&#8217;est la moitié de la bataille gagnée. Si vous n’abandonnez pas, c&#8217;est l&#8217;autre moitié qui est gagnée.</p>\n<p>2269. Il n&#8217;y a rien qui ne puisse pas être utilisé pour le bien ou pour le mal, que ce soit un fusil, un couteau, un mur, une compétence ou un outil, une pierre ou un oreiller, un bâton, une voiture, un lit, une tarte, un talent, une chanson ou un instrument de musique, un chien ou un autre être humain, une force ou une faiblesse, un médicament ou un poison, la connaissance ou l’ignorance, des richesses ou la pauvreté, la religion ou la sécularité, un sourire ou un froncement de sourcils, un mot ou un silence &#8230; la bonté ou le mal.</p>\n<p>2270. Si un homme juste tombe dans un piège, ça lui fera peu de mal mais cela ne fera aucun bien au trappeur.</p>\n<p>2271. Même si un homme juste tombe dans un piège, le piégeur ne prospérera pas.</p>\n<p>2272. Ceux un peu dans le mal deviennent suspects de tout mal.</p>\n<p>2273. Ça paye d&#8217;écouter même si vous ne comprenez pas ; ça paye d&#8217;écouter encore et encore jusqu&#8217;à ce que vous compreniez.</p>\n<p>2274. Ce n&#8217;est pas toujours ce qui est consommé mais aussi ce qui tombe au sol qui produit.</p>\n<p>2275. Il y a un dicton : « Donne jusqu&#8217;à ce que ça fasse mal. »  Mais je dis, il n&#8217;y a pas de véritable don à moins que ça fasse mal.</p>\n<p>2276. Battre les épées en charrues est un battement de cœur.</p>\n<p>2277. Les faux espoirs ne meurent pas mais bien les insensés qui s&#8217;y accrochent.</p>\n<p>2278. Les hommes vivent comme des diables et sont enterrés comme des saints.</p>\n<p>2279. Tout comme la chanson, chanter ne vient pas du corps mais du cœur.</p>\n<p>2280. Tu ne perds jamais parce que tu échoues à établir une relation ; tu perds seulement parce que la relation est si importante pour toi.</p>\n<p>2281. Où étais-tu lorsque le monde était sans toi ? Où seras-tu lorsqu’il continuera après toi ?</p>\n<p>2282. Ceux qui ont passé leur vie en vue d’un revenu terrestre découvriront en fin de compte qu&#8217;ils ont gaspillé beaucoup de temps et d&#8217;énergie.</p>\n<p>2283. Un accomplissement commence par un rêve, puis un désir, puis un engagement complet jusqu’à la mort.</p>\n<p>2284. Que ce soit dans ce qui est séculier ou sacré, dans le saint ou le profane, dans le monde terrestre ou céleste, les hommes doivent apprendre les leçons qui leur sont attribuées.</p>\n<p>2285. Jésus-Christ, la Personne, Dieu Tout-Puissant, Créateur de tout, par Qui et pour Qui toutes choses ont été faites, est LA Réponse à tout problème possible. La foi en Lui est la Clé. Il n&#8217;y a pas d&#8217;autre réponse.</p>\n<p>2286. Celui qui perd mais n’abandonne pas, gagne ; celui qui abandonne ne fait que perdre.</p>\n<p>2287. Si vous ne vous conduisez pas de façon respectueuse, vous ne pouvez pas vous attendre à être respecté.</p>\n<p>2288. Une porte fermée ne laisse rien sortir, mais elle ne laisse rien entrer non plus.</p>\n<p>2289. Qu&#8217;il s&#8217;agisse d&#8217;un petit ou d&#8217;un gros mensonge, qu&#8217;une chose soit faible ou forte, grande ou petite, c&#8217;est tout pareil.</p>\n<p>2290. Les méchants sont toujours innocents et les innocents sont toujours méchants.</p>\n<p>2291. Celui qui craint les conséquences de ne pas craindre Dieu au lieu de craindre Dieu s’appelle un hypocondriaque.</p>\n<p>2292. Un hypocondriaque est quelqu&#8217;un qui a mauvaise conscience. Il a peur du jugement parce qu&#8217;il refuse de croire et d&#8217;obéir à Dieu.</p>\n<p>2293. Celui qui vit dans la peur vit dans le péché. Il peut réprimander l&#8217;esprit de peur ou essayer de résister à l&#8217;influence du diable, mais il doit s&#8217;attaquer à la racine du problème, qui est le péché. Et une fois qu&#8217;il aura traité son péché, il n&#8217;aura plus peur.</p>\n<p>2294. La liberté vient avec l&#8217;obéissance et l&#8217;esclavage avec la désobéissance.</p>\n<p>2295. La miséricorde de Dieu est une bénédiction imméritée, mais oh, quel prix terrible il y a à payer si on la tient pour acquise !</p>\n<p>2296. La fumée est la preuve de la destruction.</p>\n<p>2297. La retraite est la voie rapide vers la tombe.</p>\n<p>2298. Il ne devrait y avoir aucune honte à avoir tort, seulement à choisir le tort.</p>\n<p>2299. La convoitise est plus évidente dans ce que l&#8217;on fait avec les biens d&#8217;autrui qu&#8217;avec les siens.</p>\n<p>2300. La vraie richesse est toujours à l&#8217;intérieur, jamais à l&#8217;extérieur.</p>\n<p>2301. Quand on est riche, on n&#8217;a besoin de rien.</p>\n<p>2302. Votre adversaire n&#8217;est jamais le problème ; le problème est votre adversaire.</p>\n<p>2303. Quand le temps et l’occasion viennent pour vous, la résistance est vaine.</p>\n<p>2304. Votre bataille sera gagnée lorsque cela ne vous dérangera pas que votre adversaire ait tort ; elle sera doublement gagnée lorsque cela ne vous dérangera pas d’avoir tort.</p>\n<p>2305. Au lieu de vous condamner en ombrageant la Vérité, placez-vous dans Son ombre où vous serez en parfaite sécurité.</p>\n<p>2306. Celui qui aime le gain déteste la perte davantage.</p>\n<p>2307. La musique dans sa forme authentique est le couronnement glorieux de la grâce.</p>\n<p>2308. La fierté est une haute muraille à l&#8217;apprentissage, mais l&#8217;humilité y est une porte ouverte.</p>\n<p>2309. Honorer un étranger est un investissement potentiellement prometteur et un rendement profitable pour les deux parties.</p>\n<p>2310. Boire de l&#8217;eau pure et recevoir de sages conseils est rafraîchissant pour une âme assoiffée.</p>\n<p>2311. D’abord regardez, écoutez, sentez, goûtez et réfléchissez avant de manger. De même, jugez soigneusement ce que les autres ont à dire.</p>\n<p>2312. Choisissez entre la discipline d&#8217;un parent attentionné et la punition inévitable d&#8217;un monde rempli de parents indifférents.</p>\n<p>2313. L&#8217;honnêteté est un antidote puissant contre la peur et la bonne conscience une excellente prévention contre l&#8217;inquiétude.</p>\n<p>2314. Celui qui compte sur les ténèbres pour satisfaire se retrouvera dans le l’abîme sans fond.</p>\n<p>2315. Ceux qui signalent la vertu en sont dépourvus.</p>\n<p>2316. Lorsque vous avez vendu le client à lui-même, vous avez ouvert une autoroute dorée pour conclure l&#8217;affaire que vous proposez.</p>\n<p>2317. La vérité blesse, mais seulement quand on la combat. Une chose est sûre : vous ne pouvez pas blesser la Vérité.</p>\n<p>2318. Le politiquement correct est comme le contenu d&#8217;une cuvette de toilettes avec la chasse non-tirée – désagréable et pas destiné à être valorisé ou préservé.</p>\n<p>2319. Certains font le mal et sont appelés malfaiteurs ; certains flirtent avec le mal et sont appelés hypocrites ; certains sont en désaccord avec le mal et sont appelés cyniques ; certains s&#8217;opposent au mal et sont appelés artisans de paix.</p>\n<p>2320. De même que Dieu ne mettrait pas des vêtements propres sur un corps sale, ainsi Il ne mettra pas Sa Parole Pure dans la bouche de celui dont le cœur n&#8217;est pas sanctifié.</p>\n<p>2321. Paroles, paroles, même de bonnes paroles – toutes vaines à moins d&#8217;être semées et arrosées pour porter du fruit.</p>\n<p>2322. Celui qui envie le juste vaut à peine mieux que celui qui envie le méchant.</p>\n<p>2323. Ceux qui vivent de leurs œuvres ont confiance en eux-mêmes et ne peuvent jamais être satisfaits, mais ceux qui vivent par la grâce ont confiance en leur Créateur et se reposent en paix.</p>\n<p>2324. Mieux vaut avoir des gens qui comprennent plutôt que des gens qui croient savoir.</p>\n<p>2325. Être humilié, c&#8217;est échouer et être montré que l&#8217;on n&#8217;a pas ce que l’on croit avoir.</p>\n<p>2326. Vous allez peut-être vite avec impatience, mais vous allez dans la mauvaise direction.</p>\n<p>2327. Enlevez la peur et vous êtes un vainqueur. En tant que vainqueur, on a la domination sur tous les ennemis, à l&#8217;intérieur et à l&#8217;extérieur.</p>\n<p>2328. Voudriez-vous vous faire un ami ? Soyez-en un.</p>\n<p>2329. Vous devez apprendre à marcher par la foi si jamais vous voulez marcher avec le Seigneur.</p>\n<p>2330. Soyez prêt à accepter de lourdes épreuves et des larmes si jamais vous voulez marcher avec le Seigneur.</p>\n<p>2331. Ne prends jamais la route qui a l’air si aplanie ; elle est aplanie à cause des foules qui y sont bêtement passées ;</p>\n<p>2332. La route qui est rarement empruntée, avec des pierres et des trous pour les invités qui voyagent est la route qui te mène à la vérité de la vie.</p>\n<p>2333. C&#8217;est formidable d&#8217;être quelqu&#8217;un parce que vous n&#8217;êtes personne parce que vous êtes à Lui.</p>\n<p>2334. Il y a ceux qui adorent Dieu et essaient de faire sa volonté à leur façon comme un cheval que le Maître n&#8217;a pas débourré.</p>\n<p>2335. Il y a un but partout dans toutes les plus petites choses qu&#8217;Il fait, et bien que notre compréhension ne puisse pas le voir, cependant, Lui faire confiance et obéir est le seul et unique chemin.</p>\n<p>2336. Les nuages et la fumée peuvent se ressembler, mais ils sont tellement différents.</p>\n<p>2337. Regarde tout autour et les gens meurent. Ils détestent marcher ; ils doivent voler. Mais six pieds sous terre, leurs familles et leurs amis pleurent.</p>\n<p>2338. Prends une leçon du grand dinosaure : il n’est pas allé très loin ; prête l’oreille et entends les moineaux te raconter leur histoire.</p>\n<p>2339. Pour gagner une course, il y en a mille dans une cohue, mais seulement l’un d’entre eux est destiné à être fort. Vas-tu me dire que neuf cent nonante-neuf ont tort ?</p>\n<p>2340. Prends une leçon de certaines herbes : regarde et vois qu’elles sont mangées par des ânes, mais quand les ânes s’en vont, les herbes restent pour pousser.</p>\n<p>2341. Tu n’as pas besoin de vivre selon les attentes des autres ; tu vas donner trop de palpitations à ton cœur. Fais ce que tu peux pour l’instant et mets doucement le reste de côté.</p>\n<p>2342. Vas-y doucement, il y a une raison à la nuit ; il y a un temps et une saison pour toute chose. Tu ne trouveras jamais un arbre qui porte des fruits tout le temps.</p>\n<p>2343. Doucement, mon ami, ne sois pas perplexe. Tu ne perds jamais parce que tu échoues à établir une relation. Tu perds seulement parce que la relation est si importante pour toi.</p>\n<p>2344. Où étais-tu lorsque le monde était sans toi ? Où seras-tu lorsqu’il continuera après toi ?</p>\n<p>2345. Il est un endroit pas très loin, un endroit que les saints désirent et demandent en prière, et lorsqu’ils y vont, ils sont là pour y rester.</p>\n<p>2346. Ce n&#8217;est que par le sang que la vérité sera partagée. La vérité va à la potence pour que les autres soient épargnés.</p>\n<p>2347. Mon plus grand besoin est de faire passer les besoins des autres avant les miens. Quand je fais cela, mes besoins seront satisfaits.</p>\n<p>2348. Ceux qui aiment la vaine flatterie détestent la critique constructive.</p>\n<p>2349. Le fou parle pour lui-même, alors il ouvre la bouche à tout moment. Le sage parle pour les autres, alors il ferme sa bouche jusqu&#8217;au moment.</p>\n<p>2350. Pour les insensés inflexibles, il n&#8217;y a pas de correction, seulement la destruction.</p>\n<p>2351. Le fou dit au sage de fermer sa bouche ; le sage ferme la bouche du fou.</p>\n<p>2352. L&#8217;essence de ce qui a de la valeur attire la critique. Ce qui est sans valeur mérite peu d&#8217;attention.</p>\n<p>2353. Tout comme on ne mettrait pas de l’eau propre dans une tasse sale, ainsi Dieu ne mettra pas Sa Parole dans la bouche de celui dont le cœur n&#8217;est pas sanctifié.</p>\n<p>2354. Il est de loin plus facile de faire un grand mal qu&#8217;un peu de bien.</p>\n<p>2355. Quiconque dit qu&#8217;il a hâte d&#8217;aller au Paradis n&#8217;a aucune idée de ce dont il parle.</p>\n<p>2356. Il n&#8217;y a pas de puissance sans la douleur, pas de victoire sans capitulation, et pas de gloire sans honte.</p>\n<p>2357. La Liberté est le destin de l&#8217;Honnêteté.</p>\n<p>2358. Les lâches arrivent à peine à être honnêtes à propos des autres, combien moins à propos d’eux-mêmes.</p>\n<p>2359. La hâte sème la déception mais la patience récolte la satisfaction et la joie.</p>\n<p>2360. L&#8217;impatience est la convoitise du temps et de la production.</p>\n<p>2361. L&#8217;obéissance est sagesse ; on apprend la sagesse par la souffrance.</p>\n<p>2362. Comme tous les nuages jettent de l’ombre, ainsi l&#8217;impatience et l&#8217;incrédulité coûtent toujours. Mais la patience et la foi sont comme un ciel dégagé.</p>\n<p>2363. Une assurance complète et une sécurité digne de confiance ne sont disponibles qu&#8217;à l&#8217;intérieur.</p>\n<p>2364. Une personne riche peut se permettre de mal s&#8217;habiller.</p>\n<p>2365. S&#8217;occuper des intérêts d&#8217;autrui comme s&#8217;ils étaient les nôtres s&#8217;appelle fidélité.</p>\n<p>2366. Au moment où l’on cesse de se soucier d&#8217;avoir tort, on a raison.</p>\n<p>2367. Le chagrin et la souffrance sont l&#8217;étoffe de la gloire.</p>\n<p>2368. Les pauvres sont les riches et les riches sont les pauvres ; les faibles sont les forts et les forts sont les faibles.</p>\n<p>2369. Le serviteur commande et le maître obéit ; la tête est la queue et la queue est la tête.</p>\n<p>2370. Celui qui ne regarde jamais en arrière s&#8217;empare de Jérusalem sans tirer un coup de feu.</p>\n<p>2371. Publiez la Vérité ; les ténèbres sont bannies par la Lumière.</p>\n<p>2372. La gauche commence le combat et la droite le termine.</p>\n<p>2373. Contre l&#8217;honnêteté et la Vérité, il n&#8217;y a ni arme ni défense.</p>\n<p>2374. Mieux vaut regarder devant qu&#8217;en arrière, contempler une table de banquet qu&#8217;une cuvette de toilettes.</p>\n<p>2375. Ce qui est passé est passé ; lâchez prise. Pourquoi voudriez-vous être constipé au lieu d&#8217;être rassasié ?</p>\n<p>2376. Si nous sommes prêts à supporter les défauts et les infirmités des uns et des autres, nous récolterons les fruits de leurs forces et de leurs qualités. Ne sommes-nous pas prêts à dépasser la peau d&#8217;un fruit ou d&#8217;un légume pour en savourer la chair ?</p>\n<p>2377. Un homme n&#8217;est pas libre tant qu&#8217;il ne peut pas pleurer librement en public.</p>\n<p>2378. La douleur est le processus.</p>\n<p>2379. La commodité de quelques-uns doit céder la place à la sécurité du plus grand nombre, mais les gauchistes disent que le bénéfice du plus grand nombre doit céder la place au privilège de quelques membres de l’élite.</p>\n<p>2380. Les vraies larmes sont plus puissantes que les balles, mais les fausses larmes activent le tireur.</p>\n<p>2381. Cette génération est oh, tellement coupable d&#8217;innocence. Essayez de les corriger et ils se défendront, jusqu&#8217;à votre mort, si nécessaire.</p>\n<p>2382. Les incorrigibles remplissent fidèlement leur fonction ; c&#8217;est pourquoi ils sont incorrigibles.</p>\n<p>2383. Dieu est fidèle pour avertir Ses serviteurs, mais les insensés sont livrés à la destruction sans avertissement, car ils sont des brutes.</p>\n<p>2384. Béni soit l&#8217;homme dont le privilège est de rester immobile et de voir le Seigneur mener ses batailles.</p>\n<p>2385. Béni soit l&#8217;homme qui a des amis fidèles. Il est ainsi béni parce qu&#8217;il a été un ami fidèle.</p>\n<p>2386. Béni soit l&#8217;homme dont le but est de donner et non de recevoir.</p>\n<p>2387. Béni soit l&#8217;homme dont l&#8217;honneur est apprécié et non méprisé.</p>\n<p>2388. Béni soit l&#8217;homme dont l&#8217;honneur est mérité et non exigé.</p>\n<p>2389. Béni soit l&#8217;homme qui ne craint que Dieu et aucun homme.</p>\n<p>2390. Bénis soient ceux qui servent un homme béni.</p>\n<p>2391. Béni soit celui qui fait confiance au Seigneur pour obtenir vengeance contre ceux qui l&#8217;offensent.</p>\n<p>2392. Béni soit l&#8217;homme qui croit ; il se repose en paix.</p>\n<p>2393. Béni soit celui dont le seul désir n&#8217;est que le bien ; il est l&#8217;ami de Dieu.</p>\n<p>2394. Béni soit l&#8217;homme qui a dix ennemis et un seul ami. La balance est en sa faveur.</p>\n<p>2395. Heureux celui qui a appris à ne pas juger selon les apparences ; il connaitra la Vérité.</p>\n<p>2396. Heureux l&#8217;homme qui est satisfait de ce qu&#8217;il a ; il lui en sera donné davantage.</p>\n<p>2397. Heureux l&#8217;homme qui connaît son Dieu ; il ne peut être mû par aucun problème ni arrêté par aucun obstacle &#8211; tout le pouvoir au Ciel et sur terre est sien.</p>\n<p>2398. Les étoiles et les anges se tiennent prêts à se battre pour l&#8217;homme de foi ; malheur à ses ennemis ; ils ne savent pas.</p>\n<p>2399. J&#8217;ai appris que la vengeance de Dieu sur ceux qu&#8217;un homme mauvais hait est une fraction de ce que cet homme mauvais choisirait, mais la vengeance de Dieu sur ces ennemis qui haïssent un homme juste est dix fois supérieure à ce que l&#8217;homme juste désirerait.</p>\n<p>2400. Les amis d&#8217;un homme le servent de bon cœur ; les ennemis d&#8217;un homme le servent involontairement.</p>\n<p>2401. Tout comme le Ciel est plus haut que la terre, ainsi la sagesse et la compréhension sont plus élevées que l&#8217;argent et l&#8217;or.</p>\n<p>2402. Un homme sage aime ce qui est bon et fait prospérer ceux qui l&#8217;entourent dans la justice ; l&#8217;insensé aime le mal et détruit à la fois le juste et le méchant.</p>\n<p>2403. Il existe aujourd&#8217;hui une expression vulgaire et c&#8217;est le cachet commun représentant la chute de cette génération.</p>\n<p>2404. Nos efforts pour gagner et nous améliorer sur terre diminuent lentement en puissance peu à peu, mais la valeur de notre travail en vue d’une vie après la mort ne peut qu&#8217;augmenter en valeur. Sinon, quel est le but ?</p>\n<p>2405. Faites toujours confiance à Dieu pour équilibrer les comptes. Nous ne savons même pas compter, mais Il est le Contrôleur par excellence.</p>\n<p>2406. Celui qui subit le vol et l&#8217;injustice innocemment sera indemnisé, et celui qui vole et est injuste sera également indemnisé.</p>\n<p>2407. En tant qu&#8217;êtres humains, nous sommes beaucoup plus enclins à nous faire des ennemis de nos amis que des amis de nos ennemis. Le fils de Dieu est appelé à aimer ses ennemis et il entend et obéit.</p>\n<p>2408. Même les sourds peuvent entendre la musique qui est plus qu’un son.</p>\n<p>2409. Il y a beaucoup de chansons et beaucoup de chanteurs, mais une seule chanson.</p>\n<p>2410. Nous voyons comment une biche fréquentera le même endroit pour se nourrir à plusieurs reprises bien qu&#8217;elle ne trouve rien lors de plusieurs visites. Et puis, elle trouve ce qu&#8217;elle cherche. La foi et la patience sont ses atouts et lui assurent le succès ultime.</p>\n<p>2411. Toutes choses, à la fois bonnes et mauvaises, arrivent jusqu’à ce qu’un jour, l&#8217;espoir se change en assurance, et la bonté vient pour rester.</p>\n<p>2412. Un arbre mort peut être plus utile qu&#8217;un arbre vivant. Le mort et le vivant ont tous deux leur place.</p>\n<p>2413. Je connais un menteur qui est le premier à croire ses mensonges.</p>\n<p>2414. Bien qu&#8217;ils aient un air semblable pour un instant, quelle différence entre un lever et un coucher de soleil – l&#8217;un apporte la lumière et l&#8217;autre, l&#8217;obscurité. Une leçon quotidienne sur les œuvres du bien et du mal.</p>\n<p>2415. Toutes faveurs ne sont pas gagnées ou méritées ; certaines sont accordées gratuitement, mais qu&#8217;elles ne soient pas tenues pour acquises.</p>\n<p>2416. Le travail bien fait d&#8217;un homme est son plus grand plaisir.</p>\n<p>2417. Dieu, en effet, gâte Ses enfants, et Il le fait d&#8217;une seule manière – par les Sabéens et les Chaldéens.</p>\n<p>2418. Pour avoir des amis, il faut être un ami.</p>\n<p>2419. Les critiques ont plus de valeur que les flatteurs et les flagorneurs.</p>\n<p>2420. Les enfants ne considèrent pas leurs parents comme les parents considèrent leurs enfants.</p>\n<p>2421. Les connexions sont bonnes, mais les relations sont meilleures.</p>\n<p>2422. Si la lumière est plus grande que les ténèbres, et elle l’est, alors il n&#8217;y a pas de problème insoluble.</p>\n<p>2423. Il n’existe pas une telle chose qu’une question sans vraie réponse.</p>\n<p>2424. Le pardon dit : « Oui, vous avez fait du mal, vous m&#8217;avez fait du mal, mais je renonce à tout droit de vengeance ou de mal envers vous pour cela. Que Dieu soit juge ; je remets mon cas entre les mains de Celui Qui Seul connaît tous les faits. »</p>\n<p>2425. Tout ce que l&#8217;homme a touché, il l&#8217;a souillé, afin d&#8217;apprendre qu&#8217;il ne peut égaler son Créateur.</p>\n<p>2426. Il y a toujours eu un reste de mal dans le bien et de bien dans le mal.</p>\n<p>2427. La facilité tend vers le gâchis et la difficulté vers l’amélioration.</p>\n<p>2428. Évolutionnistes, faites attention et baissez vos têtes. Pourquoi devriez-vous rester dans vos tombes avec la face tournée vers le haut et sans espoir pour toujours ?</p>\n<p>2429. Le gant du mensonge convient parfaitement à la main humaine ; aucun autre gant ne fera l&#8217;affaire.</p>\n<p>2430. Il est beaucoup plus facile d&#8217;être humble et honnête lorsque vous êtes confiant et respecté. Il est beaucoup plus facile d&#8217;être confiant et respecté lorsque vous êtes humble et honnête.</p>\n<p>2431. Il est beaucoup plus facile d&#8217;être honnête et confiant quand on a de l’humilité.</p>\n<p>2432. Il est plus facile de se respecter quand on est respecté par les autres. Il est beaucoup plus facile d&#8217;être respecté par les autres quand on se respecte soi-même.</p>\n<p>2433. Un Vrai Chrétien ne se définit pas par son incapacité à faire aucun mal, mais par son choix constant de ne pas faire le mal.</p>\n<p>2434. Ceux qui choisissent de plaire à leurs semblables sont des traîtres envers leur Créateur, et ceux qui choisissent de plaire à Dieu déplairont certainement à leurs semblables.</p>\n<p>2435. On peut rarement, voire jamais, déterminer la position d&#8217;autrui auprès de Dieu par une quelconque association ou activité extérieure.</p>\n<p>2436. Les gens crient pour la délivrance des conséquences du péché, mais qui crie pour la délivrance du péché ?</p>\n<p>2437. Faire confiance au Seigneur au milieu de n&#8217;importe quel mal est la chose la plus gratifiante dont l&#8217;homme puisse faire l’expérience ; c&#8217;est aussi ce qui plaît le plus à Dieu.</p>\n<p>2438. On ne peut pas avoir le bien sans le mal ou le mal sans le bien.</p>\n<p>2439. Le mal est le moyen qui forme le bien.</p>\n<p>2440. Non seulement devons-nous pardonner à ceux qui nous font du mal ; nous devons remercier Dieu pour eux parce qu&#8217;il nous les envoie pour notre grand bénéfice.</p>\n<p>2441. Si vous avez peur de perdre, vous avez peur de gagner, comme on a peur d&#8217;un voyage vers une destination.</p>\n<p>2442. L&#8217;arrogance confond la capacité avec l&#8217;infaillibilité mais est incapable de réaliser qu’elle fait ainsi.</p>\n<p>2443. L&#8217;orgueil est rarement corrigé par des instructions douces et plus souvent par l&#8217;humiliation de sévères circonstances.</p>\n<p>2444. La patience est le but de l&#8217;accomplissement que la patience attend.</p>\n<p>2445. Le vrai fruit de la patience est d&#8217;accomplir ce qui était nécessaire et non ce qui était attendu.</p>\n<p>2446. Les sages de ce monde parcourent une route poussiéreuse qui ne mène nulle part.</p>\n<p>2447. Les sages de ce monde ne réalisent pas que leur propre arrivée est la destination.</p>\n<p>2448. Lorsqu&#8217;ils atteignent la fin d&#8217;eux-mêmes, ceux qui sont sages à leurs propres yeux sont morts de fatigue d&#8217;un voyage infructueux ; ce n&#8217;est qu&#8217;alors qu&#8217;ils pourront s’engager dans la bonne direction par un bon moyen.</p>\n<p>2449. La religion et la vraie foi en Dieu sont aussi opposées que la superstition et la vérité.</p>\n<p>2450. Un homme imbu de lui-même méprise la sustentation.</p>\n<p>2451. Avoir beaucoup de connaissances est un détriment dans l&#8217;acquisition de la sagesse.</p>\n<p>2452. Celui qui croit en lui-même est comme une branche qui n&#8217;a pas besoin d’un tronc. Il est loin de Dieu.</p>\n<p>2453. Celui qui croit en lui-même doit donner un coup de marteau à son idole.</p>\n<p>2454. La tombe est la fin de l&#8217;autosuffisance. Seuls les morts n&#8217;ont besoin de rien de plus.</p>\n<p>2455. La foi voit l&#8217;invisible et sait ce qui est réel.</p>\n<p>2456. Juste au moment où je pense que j&#8217;en sais tant, un enfant vient me montrer mon besoin.</p>\n<p>2457. Une chenille peut ramper et devenir un papillon, mais un papillon ne peut que voler et mourir.</p>\n<p>2458. Si on peut répondre au pourquoi, ne peut-on pas répondre à toutes les questions ?</p>\n<p>2459. La sagesse de Dieu est dans un rocher, un brin d&#8217;herbe, une goutte d&#8217;eau, une humble créature. Les fiers ne savent pas ces choses.</p>\n<p>2460. Un rocher peut avoir plus de sagesse qu&#8217;un homme qui pense que le rocher ne le peut pas.</p>\n<p>2461. Il n&#8217;y a de vraie satisfaction dans personne d’autre que Dieu au lieu de soi-même.</p>\n<p>2462. La vie est une équation de lumière et d&#8217;obscurité, de bien et de mal, un équilibre harmonieux des contraires.</p>\n<p>2463. Dieu a tant aimé Son fils qu&#8217;Il lui a donné tout pouvoir dans les Cieux et sur la terre.</p>\n<p>2464. Beaucoup d&#8217;informations sont disponibles dans ce qui n&#8217;est pas facilement perçu par les sens, mais qui peut parler plus fort et plus clairement.</p>\n<p>2465. Il n&#8217;y a nulle part de bien où l&#8217;on ne trouve le mal, et nulle part de mal où l&#8217;on ne trouve pas de bien. On ne peut séparer ce qui est inextricablement lié et ne font qu’un.</p>\n<p>2466. Il existe des combinaisons du bien et du mal créées par Dieu et des combinaisons du bien et du mal créées par l&#8217;homme. L&#8217;une est bonne et l&#8217;autre, mauvaise.</p>\n<p>2467. Sans deux de quoi que ce soit, il n&#8217;y a rien.</p>\n<p>2468. Comme une rivière continuant à couler, les richesses de ce monde ne sont pas destinées à être accumulées mais à exercer l&#8217;âme à recevoir et à relâcher.</p>\n<p>2469. Dans un monde conçu pour le conflit, si vous ne recevez pas d’opposition à ce que vous faites, il se peut bien que vous ayez tout à fait tort.</p>\n<p>2470. Peut-être que ça marche comme un canard et cancane comme un canard, mais si ça hait l’eau, ce n’est pas un canard.</p>\n<p>2471. Il est souvent improductif de se mettre d&#8217;accord pour ne pas être d’accord et productif de ne pas être d’accord pour se mettre d’accord.</p>\n<p>2472. La réalité finira toujours par surpasser la fantaisie.</p>\n<p>2473. Quelle est douloureuse, la désillusion, mais bien nécessaire, comme la clé d&#8217;une porte de prison verrouillée !</p>\n<p>2474. Moïse n&#8217;était pas un homme aussi grand que Charlton Heston et bien plus grand.</p>\n<p>2475. La vraie victoire est un voyage pas à pas.</p>\n<p>2476. La foi détermine la distance jusqu&#8217;au sommet de la montagne.</p>\n<p>2477. Toute la création est faite de fractales. Une fractale est une copie de ce qui est plus grand qui en est composé avec d&#8217;autres semblables.</p>\n<p>2478. Sans le moindre, il n&#8217;y a pas de plus grand ; tous sont un. Que le plus grand respecte le moindre en tant que plus grand. Que le moindre soit à l&#8217;aise avec le plus grand en tant que moindre.</p>\n<p>2479. Comme une arme à feu ou un couteau, le pragmatisme peut être utilisé à la fois pour le bien ou pour le mal.</p>\n<p>2480. La colère et la haine sont très bonnes, si elles sont en réponse au mensonge et à l&#8217;injustice.</p>\n<p>2481. Où, quand, comment et pourquoi la vérité est-elle interdite d’être dite et par qui ? C&#8217;est la prérogative exclusive de la Vérité.</p>\n<p>2482. L&#8217;histoire est très récente et même présente. Aux jeunes, je dis : « Demain, vous serez là où je suis, vous en étonnerez, et vous souviendrez que je vous l&#8217;avais dit. »</p>\n<p>2483. La perception est souvent un ennemi redoutable de la réalité.</p>\n<p>2484. Une opinion n&#8217;est jamais une chose sûre ; seule la Vérité l’est.</p>\n<p>2485. Lorsque l&#8217;opinion et la Vérité se rencontrent, l&#8217;opinion doit céder ou la mort et l&#8217;enfer s&#8217;ensuivent.</p>\n<p>2486. Le pragmatisme et la vérité ne sont pas toujours la même chose ; le pragmatisme s&#8217;occupe de ce qui est opportun pour le pragmatiste tandis que la vérité sert tous.</p>\n<p>2487. Malheur à celui qui sert le pragmatisme ; bénis sont ceux qui servent la Vérité.</p>\n<p>2488. Il est intéressant de voir comment deux personnes peuvent regarder en rétrospective une relation et des circonstances qu&#8217;elles ont partagées, une personne avec appréciation et nostalgie, et une autre avec regret et ressentiment &#8211; deux perspectives et attitudes opposées.</p>\n<p>2489. Parfois, le bas est meilleur que le haut, comme avec un verre à moitié plein.</p>\n<p>2490. Pour toute personne, homme ou femme, être capable de malfaisances de la pire espèce est une conclusion courue d’avance. La différence entre les gens réside dans ce qu&#8217;ils choisissent de faire.</p>\n<p>2491. Bénie soit cette personne qui décide d&#8217;avoir foi en Dieu et patience avec les hommes.</p>\n<p>2492. Heureux cet homme qui peut répondre et continuer à marcher à grands pas face aux maux qui l&#8217;assaillent.</p>\n<p>2493. Quelle est l&#8217;utilité de se comparer à un autre lorsque chacun est créé dans un but entièrement différent ?</p>\n<p>2494. Le bien et le mal sont entre les mains du Créateur Qui a créé les deux pour Ses Desseins.</p>\n<p>2495. Il y a un Dessein Divin pour les amis et un Dessein Divin pour les ennemis.</p>\n<p>2496. Nos ennemis peuvent nous servir comme la plus grande des faveurs.</p>\n<p>2497. Pourquoi ceux qui nous aiment doivent-ils servir dans des désagréments à notre égard ? Comment ceux qui nous haïssent peuvent-ils nous faire autant de bien ?</p>\n<p>2498. Même le fumier de ce qui est pur permet à nos champs et à nos jardins de produire de la bonne nourriture.</p>\n<p>2499. Les ennuis viennent pour humilier tandis que la paix et la prospérité peuvent ouvrir la voie à l&#8217;orgueil et ramener l&#8217;âme aux ennuis.</p>\n<p>2500. Quelle âme y a-t-il qui puisse échapper aux fruits de ses actions ? Ce serait comme une rivière coulant à l&#8217;opposé de sa direction naturelle.</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/french/proverbes-2001-2250.htm\"><strong>&lt;&lt; PREVIOUS</strong></a>                             <a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/french/proverbes-2501-2750.htm\"><strong>NEXT &gt;&gt;</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Retour à la liste des </strong><a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/french/index.htm\"><strong>articles disponibles en français</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>\n<!-- relpost-thumb-wrapper --><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><!-- filter-class --><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><!-- relpost-block-container --><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/french/proverbes-1251-1500.htm\"class=\"relpost-block-single\" ><div class=\"relpost-custom-block-single\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 275px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"<b>Proverbes 1251-1500</b>\"  style=\"background: transparent url(https://www.thepathoftruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/w1-small.png) no-repeat scroll 0% 0%; width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-single-text\"  style=\"font-family: Helvetica;  font-size: 12px;  color: #333333;\"><b>Proverbes 1251-1500</b><br/>Les principes de la vie ont de nombreuses manifestations, chacune d’entre elles pouvant être exprimée comme un proverbe.

La volonté est la mère de la possibilité.</p>\n<p>2506. Il n&#8217;existe pas de personne qui soit aussi honnête qu&#8217;il n&#8217;y paraît.</p>\n<p>2507. Les menteurs semblent les plus honnêtes et leurs mensonges les plus crédibles lorsqu&#8217;ils croient à leurs propres mensonges.</p>\n<p>2508. Les rouges-gorges nichent près des gens, ce qui les protège des oiseaux qui ne sont pas à l&#8217;aise près des gens.</p>\n<p>2509. Les gens ne sont pas reconnus au nombre d&#8217;amis qu&#8217;ils ont, mais par quel genre d&#8217;amis ils gardent.</p>\n<p>2510. Lorsque des problèmes surviennent, c’est que Dieu vous murmure de venir à Lui. Lorsque vous L&#8217;invoquez et qu&#8217;il n&#8217;y a que le silence, c’est que Dieu vous crie de venir à Lui.</p>\n<p>2511. Après l&#8217;orgueil vient la honte et après l&#8217;humilité vient la gloire.</p>\n<p>2512. Avant le travail vient l&#8217;opportunité et après le travail vient la récompense.</p>\n<p>2513. Lorsque des chiens et des porcs entrent dans le cercle de vie d&#8217;un serviteur de Dieu, c&#8217;est pour leur jugement final.</p>\n<p>2514. Il y a des pacificateurs et il y a des artisans de paix ; ils sont aussi différents que la nuit et le jour.</p>\n<p>2515. Ceux qui ne veulent pas offenser un ami ou un voisin sont une offense à Dieu.</p>\n<p>2516. L&#8217;intimidateur déploie ses efforts sur les autres pour se consoler de sa valeur.</p>\n<p>2517. Celui qui diminue les autres et ce qu&#8217;ils ont, se diminue lui-même et ce qu&#8217;il a.</p>\n<p>2518. L&#8217;humour est un arôme savoureux qui peut être utilisé dans presque tout ce qui est servi &#8211; ce n&#8217;est pas une blague.</p>\n<p>2519. Pensez aux pissenlits et aux chênes ; ce qui pousse lentement pousse souvent le plus fort et le plus large.</p>\n<p>2520. La liberté sans loi est la plus grande servitude de toutes.</p>\n<p>2521. Ceux qui disent qu&#8217;il n&#8217;y a pas de Dieu ne sont pas des insensés parce qu&#8217;ils ne le croient pas mais parce qu&#8217;ils savent bien qu&#8217;il y a un Dieu.</p>\n<p>2522. La religion peut être empêchée par la force, mais la vraie foi vainc toutes choses.</p>\n<p>2523. Il y a une différence entre ce dont on a besoin et ce dont on a besoin &#8211; vous avez bien lu ça.</p>\n<p>2524. Mieux vaut dire la vérité et ne pas avoir d&#8217;amis que dire des vanités et avoir mille associés.</p>\n<p>2525. L&#8217;ingrat se souvient du mal et oublie le bien, mais un cœur sage choisit la reconnaissance en toutes choses.</p>\n<p>2526. On peut rendre une humeur bonne en se souvenant du bien et en remerciant à la fois pour le bien et pour le mal.</p>\n<p>2527. Pour avoir dit la vérité, il y en aura beaucoup qui vous haïront et peu qui vous aimeront.</p>\n<p>2528. Dites-vous la vérité à des bêtes brutes ? Pourquoi perdre votre temps et risquer le danger pour rien ?</p>\n<p>2529. Les hommes tracent des lignes de division et de distinction partout pour promouvoir leurs intérêts, mais le Seigneur regarde le cœur, ne respectant pas les lignes.</p>\n<p>2530. Les hommes tracent un chemin dans la terre, mais seul le Seigneur trace un chemin dans les eaux et dans les cieux.</p>\n<p>2531. Le Seigneur met la bataille en rangs. Il détermine la place du bien et du mal, de la lumière et des ténèbres, et de la victoire et de la défaite. Il désarme les forts et les puissants et renforce les faibles et les impuissants.</p>\n<p>2532. Le pouvoir parfait vient avec celui qui marche hors des ténèbres et dans la lumière.</p>\n<p>2533. Haïr les autres pour l&#8217;amour du Seigneur, c&#8217;est ne pas donner aux autres ce qu&#8217;ils exigent de nous lorsqu’ils n’ont pas le droit de le faire.</p>\n<p>2534. Une plante ne peut vivre qu’avec de l’eau, ainsi l&#8217;âme ne peut vivre qu&#8217;avec la vérité.</p>\n<p>2535. J&#8217;ai fait de bonnes et de mauvaises choses ; j&#8217;ai été bon et mauvais ; j&#8217;ai été un pécheur et un saint ; j&#8217;ai haï Dieu et je L&#8217;ai aimé ; j&#8217;ai maudit Dieu et je L&#8217;ai béni ; j&#8217;ai été sage et insensé ; j&#8217;ai été riche et pauvre ; j&#8217;ai eu des succès et des échecs ; j&#8217;ai eu de grands gains et de grandes pertes ; j&#8217;ai été aveugle et j&#8217;ai pu voir, sourd et capable d’entendre ; j&#8217;ai été désiré et méprisé ; j&#8217;ai été haï et aimé, trahi et soutenu, béni et maudit ; j&#8217;ai connu des bons et des mauvais moments ; j&#8217;ai eu la foi et j&#8217;ai été sans foi ; j&#8217;ai été audacieux et effrayé ; j&#8217;ai aimé et j&#8217;ai haï ; j&#8217;ai été aimé et détesté ; j&#8217;ai été en surpoids et j&#8217;ai été mince et svelte ; j&#8217;ai été responsable et irresponsable ; j&#8217;ai été ivre et sobre ; j&#8217;ai été avare et généreux ; j&#8217;ai eu faim et ai été satisfait ; j&#8217;ai été fatigué et énergique ; j&#8217;ai été jeune et vieux ; j&#8217;ai été malade et bien portant ; j&#8217;ai été fort et faible ; j&#8217;ai été stupide et sage ; j&#8217;ai été occupé et immobile ; j&#8217;ai été récompensé et puni ; j&#8217;ai récompensé et puni ; j&#8217;ai été célibataire et marié ; j&#8217;ai été sans enfant et avec un enfant ; j&#8217;ai gagné des enfants et en ai perdu ; j&#8217;ai été un fils et un père ; j&#8217;ai été mort et vivant ; je suis né et je suis mort.</p>\n<p>Ces choses, je les ai été et je les ai faites parce que le Seigneur les a toutes déterminées.</p>\n<p>2536. Je n&#8217;ai pas été Dieu, mais je L&#8217;ai vu de mes yeux et je ne fais qu&#8217;un avec Lui de cœur et d&#8217;esprit.</p>\n<p>2537. Ceux qui s’assoient sur la clôture peuvent montrer un équilibre qui impressionne des deux côtés.</p>\n<p>2538. Chaque fois qu&#8217;un verre est à moitié plein, il faut dépasser le vide pour arriver au plein. Pourquoi le vide vient-il toujours en premier ?</p>\n<p>2539. Rien qui ait de la valeur n’arrive jamais facilement, pas même les dons de Dieu.</p>\n<p>2540. Il semblera que l&#8217;homme se trompe, et Dieu Se révélera parfait.</p>\n<p>2541. Les hommes croiront n&#8217;importe quel mensonge, peu importe à quel point il est scandaleux, et le défendront jusqu&#8217;à leur mort plutôt que de croire à la vérité la plus crédible.</p>\n<p>2542. La puissance vient par la quantité mais la justice par la qualité. Autrement, comment David peut-il tuer Goliath ? Autrement, comment Moïse et Aaron peuvent-ils résister seuls à la puissance de l&#8217;Égypte ? Autrement, comment un ange peut-il tuer 185 000 Syriens en une nuit ?</p>\n<p>2543. Le pouvoir dans l&#8217;ange est le pouvoir de la foi. Il en est ainsi de tous les messagers.</p>\n<p>2544. Beaucoup parlent quand ils ont peu à dire ; certains parlent parce qu&#8217;ils ont quelque chose à dire ; peu doivent d&#8217;abord parler pour dire ce qui doit être dit.</p>\n<p>2545. On n’a pas fini avant d’avoir franchi la ligne d’arrivée.</p>\n<p>2546. S&#8217;il y a une cause extérieure à notre péché et à notre problème, alors il n&#8217;y a pas de Dieu.</p>\n<p>2547. La lumière explose et les ténèbres implosent.</p>\n<p>2548. Le choix du mal lie mais le repentir libère.</p>\n<p>2549. Les anges de Dieu sont aussi grands en quantité et en forme que les nuages.</p>\n<p>2550. Chaque créature créée par le Créateur Omniscient est en partie comme Lui.</p>\n<p>2551. Des miroirs croisent notre chemin chaque jour pour nous rendre conscients de nos défauts.</p>\n<p>2552. Ceux qui s’en sont pris aux faibles et aux sans défense seront sans défense lorsque les plus puissants s’en prendront à eux. Il n&#8217;y a pas d&#8217;autre explication à une telle conséquence.</p>\n<p>2553. Il n&#8217;y a pas de satisfaction pour les égoïstes.</p>\n<p>2554. L&#8217;ennemi est identifié comme la source des peurs et de toutes sortes de pensées négatives au travers d’un manque d’évidences et de preuves à l&#8217;appui.</p>\n<p>2555. Les choses sont tellement plus grandes que nous.</p>\n<p>2556. La flatterie est la forme de mensonge la plus répugnante.</p>\n<p>2557. Ceux qui font passer la loi et l&#8217;ordre justes à la guillotine perdront leur tête.</p>\n<p>2558. Il y a ceux qui écument et ceux qui plongent, des généralistes et des spécialistes – le Seigneur les a faits tous les deux.</p>\n<p>2559. L’impardon est désagréable pour celui qui a besoin d’être pardonné, mais mortel pour celui qui ne veut pas pardonner.</p>\n<p>2560. L’apprentissage vient avant l’excellence, et ne doit pas être regretté.</p>\n<p>2561. On peut faire la différence entre le bien et le mal par les faux et terribles maux qui sont dits à propos du bien.</p>\n<p>2562. Donner n’a rien à voir avec ce qui vient avant ou après.</p>\n<p>2563. Les enfants sont des adultes et les adultes âgés sont des petits enfants.</p>\n<p>2564. Les perdants ne peuvent pas gagner parce qu&#8217;ils ne veulent pas laisser le vainqueur gagner.</p>\n<p>2565. Étonnamment, j&#8217;ai quitté une maison dans laquelle j&#8217;ai vécu toute ma vie et je suis entré dans une autre.</p>\n<p>Ma nouvelle maison est plus grande avec beaucoup plus de pièces et chaque pièce plus spacieuse que celles que nous avons connues. Les pièces sont magnifiques avec des portes et des plafonds larges et hauts, de grandes fenêtres et des meubles et fournitures beaux et raffinés. Cette maison a beaucoup plus de lumière, un air beaucoup plus pur et est bénie d&#8217;une belle musique.</p>\n<p>Cette maison est une vraie maison, tellement mieux à tous points de vue. Elle est silencieuse, parfumée et la température est constamment agréable. Elle est beaucoup plus confortable, plus conviviale, plus agréable, plus sûre, saine et incorruptible.</p>\n<p>La nourriture et l&#8217;eau sont particulièrement saines et fournies fraîches tous les jours.</p>\n<p>La maison n&#8217;a pas besoin des soins dont notre ancienne maison avait besoin, et elle est entourée de jardins fructueux et jolis. Des voisins amicaux, serviables et attentionnés vivent à proximité et s&#8217;arrêtent régulièrement. C&#8217;est le Paradis sur terre. Tout cela provenant de la main du Seigneur.</p>\n<p>2566. L&#8217;intelligence est distribuée par notre Créateur à chaque créature vivante lorsque que le besoin apparaît et que cela Lui plaît, pourtant des bêtes à deux pattes se montrent pour les insensées qu’elles ont choisi d&#8217;être.</p>\n<p>2567. La fierté est un obstacle redoutable à une bonne connaissance.</p>\n<p>2568. Être apprécié en tant que personne est une subsistance à la fois pour celui qui est apprécié et pour celui qui apprécie.</p>\n<p>2569. L&#8217;orgueilleux est facilement provoqué et lorsqu&#8217;il est provoqué, est offensé, et lorsqu&#8217;il est offensé, devient haineux, et lorsqu&#8217;il est haineux, il commet un péché. La voie de Caïn.</p>\n<p>2570. La société qui est arrivée à un état d&#8217;intolérance pour le coût, le risque et la douleur est proche de sa fin. Vous regarderez et ne la verrez plus.</p>\n<p>2571. Sans risque, il n&#8217;y a aucune opportunité de gagner ; sans coût, il n&#8217;y a pas de récompense ; sans investissement, pas de retour.</p>\n<p>2572. Le gain sans mérite est une perte de la sorte la plus lourde.</p>\n<p>2573. D&#8217;accord, homme sage et juste, réponds-moi à ceci : que fait-on en premier – prier ou faire pipi ? La réponse est très simple.</p>\n<p>2574. Pourquoi devrions-nous craindre quand l&#8217;ennemi vient ? Ne devrions-nous pas être reconnaissants d&#8217;avoir un Défenseur ?</p>\n<p>2575. La prière acceptable pour notre Père Créateur est de carrément placer notre attention sur Lui.</p>\n<p>2576. À mesure que l’on avance en âge, l&#8217;accomplissement de petites choses compense amplement l&#8217;incapacité de faire de plus grandes choses.</p>\n<p>2577. Dieu ne nous garde pas des conséquences que nous méritons, mais de faire ce qui entraîne de telles conséquences.</p>\n<p>2578. Ceux qui font le mal tomberont tous, les uns sur les autres, jusqu&#8217;à ce que tous soient dans la somme pour toujours.</p>\n<p>2579. Que le droit règne avant la prospérité, de peur que tout ne soit perdu à la fin.</p>\n<p>2580. Chanter devant les autres peut être effrayant, et ce peut être exaltant.</p>\n<p>2581. Beaucoup de gaspillage et de dommages peuvent être évités par une simple observation ; méfiez-vous et soyez avisé.</p>\n<p>2582. Si quelqu&#8217;un fuit le mal vers Dieu, il recevra de l&#8217;aide, mais si quelqu&#8217;un fuit les conséquences du mal vers Dieu, il n&#8217;y a rien à faire pour lui.</p>\n<p>2583. Si vous avez raison, vous pouvez le déclarer hardiment ; si vous vous trompez, vous feriez mieux de l&#8217;admettre rapidement.</p>\n<p>2584. Le monde déteste les justes et acclame les sans-loi. À cette fin tous les deux sont nés – celui qui est détesté, pour la gloire, et le favorisé, pour la honte.</p>\n<p>2585. N&#8217;attendez pas de gratitude de la part des bénéficiaires de vos bonnes œuvres &#8211; vous serez déçu. La vraie récompense vient toujours d&#8217;en haut.</p>\n<p>2586. Il est plus facile de juger le caractère des autres par leur jugement de moi. Cela me dira tout ce que j&#8217;ai besoin de savoir.</p>\n<p>2587. Le socialisme est la contrefaçon perverse et destructrice du Royaume de Dieu par l&#8217;homme.</p>\n<p>2588. Une génération mauvaise où les malades sont bien-portants et les bien-portants sont malades. Les coupables sont innocents et les innocents, coupables. Les justes sont méchants et les méchants, justes. Le mal est bien et le bien est mal. Les criminels forcent leurs victimes à porter des masques et les survivants sont détruits au nom de leur sauvetage.</p>\n<p>2589. Je dois poser plus de questions et donner moins de réponses.</p>\n<p>2590. J&#8217;ai besoin d&#8217;écouter plus avant de parler.</p>\n<p>2591. Considérez attentivement les circonstances actuelles autant que la discussion et laissez la discussion tenir compte des circonstances changeantes.</p>\n<p>2592. Commencez et terminez toujours par Dieu. Incluez-Le en tout, demandez à recevoir, et remerciez-Le après avoir reçu.</p>\n<p>2593. Si vous ne portez pas la guerre à Dieu, Il vous apportera la guerre.</p>\n<p>2594. La valeur d&#8217;un homme peut être jugée par la nature de ses ennemis et leurs modes de guerre.</p>\n<p>2595. Plus le four est chaud, plus les impuretés de l&#8217;or éliminées sont fines.</p>\n<p>2596. Avec la Loi vient l&#8217;ordre mais sans la Loi vient le chaos.</p>\n<p>2597. L’homme cupide mène une bataille perpétuelle – son ennemi est implacable.</p>\n<p>2598. Le chemin de la droiture est lui-même la garantie d&#8217;arriver à la destination désirée.</p>\n<p>2599. De nombreuses menaces et dangers sont réels et non imaginaires, mais les affronter avec foi en Dieu assure la sécurité et le succès.</p>\n<p>2600. Le feu purifie – ne voulez-vous pas être pur ? Le feu corrige &#8211; ne voulez-vous pas être juste ? Le feu juge – ne voulez-vous pas être innocent ? Le feu est douloureux &#8211; ne voulez-vous pas être sans douleur ?</p>\n<p>2601. Comme un four transforme l&#8217;argile brute en un état durable, les épreuves du feu éliminent la faiblesse.</p>\n<p>2602. Le feu est la façon de Dieu d’impartir Sa puissance à Ses serviteurs.</p>\n<p>2603. Les ennemis, les pertes, les échecs, les défaites et les déceptions sont les flammes du feu qui apportent gain, succès, victoire et satisfaction.</p>\n<p>2604. Les feux de l&#8217;adversité viennent pour exposer les faux amis et les vrais ennemis.</p>\n<p>2605. Les traîtres perdent tout ce qu&#8217;ils auraient pu avoir, mais les fidèles gagnent plus qu&#8217;ils n’espèrent.</p>\n<p>2606. La persistance d&#8217;une bonne chose gagnera toujours et ne perdra jamais.</p>\n<p>2607. Nous ne pouvons pas éviter la nécessité de la souffrance, mais avec l&#8217;aide de la souffrance nous pouvons accomplir notre destinée et le ferons.</p>\n<p>2608. L&#8217;ambition sans prudence sacrifiera tout ce qui est bon.</p>\n<p>2609. L&#8217;honnêteté est la denrée la plus rare chez la race humaine.</p>\n<p>2610. La peur est le plus puissant de tous les ennemis.</p>\n<p>2611. Seul l&#8217;amour peut vaincre toutes choses, même la peur.</p>\n<p>2612. La connaissance est bonne avec la sagesse et mauvaise sans elle.</p>\n<p>2613. La langue sert à entendre et les oreilles, à parler.</p>\n<p>2614. Il ne faut pas condamner des hommes fautifs pour des fautes quand ils ont, dans leur faute, détourné de la faute les hommes fautifs ; nous avons tous nos fautes.</p>\n<p>2615. La malédiction de l&#8217;homme est son engagement à être autosuffisant et indépendant de son Créateur.</p>\n<p>2616. L&#8217;homme se soucie-t-il des autres ? Ne se soucie-t-il pas que de lui-même ? N&#8217;est-ce pas le Créateur Seul Qui prend soin de Ses créatures ?</p>\n<p>2617. Comme il est remarquable que les gens marchant dans la lumière artificielle en sachent tant et ceux qui marchent dans la Vraie Lumière en sachent si peu !</p>\n<p>2618. Beaucoup de malades ne prétendent-ils pas être des guérisseurs ? Beaucoup de travailleurs sociaux ne sont-ils pas des sociopathes ?</p>\n<p>2619. Que la solution corresponde au problème et le médicament à la maladie.</p>\n<p>2620. Peu importe le problème ou la solution, ils sont tous deux internes.</p>\n<p>2621. L&#8217;adversité vient pour tous, selon notre force requise.</p>\n<p>2622. Donner ne consiste pas à répondre à des besoins ; il s&#8217;agit de croire à la Loi.</p>\n<p>2623. Quelle est la valeur d&#8217;un manoir de 100 millions de dollars pour un homme qui souffre d’un mal de dent ?</p>\n<p>2624. Celui qui préfère le matériel au Créateur est insensé. Celui qui préfère le matériel à l&#8217;homme est tout aussi insensé car l&#8217;homme est fait à l&#8217;image du Créateur.</p>\n<p>2625. Quiconque blesse indûment son prochain se blesse sept fois plus lui-même.</p>\n<p>2626. La triste réalité est que les gens préfèrent l&#8217;avantage égoïste à un ami.</p>\n<p>2627. L&#8217;amitié ne se fait jamais en obtenant mais seulement en donnant.</p>\n<p>2628. « Je serai ton ami si tu es mon ami », ne marche pas. « Tu seras mon ami si je suis ton ami », marche.</p>\n<p>2629. Celui qui prêche de bonnes choses mais ne les fait pas s’appelle un hypocrite.</p>\n<p>2630. Celui qui est prompt à parler et lent à entendre n&#8217;a pas encore appris la valeur de l&#8217;oreille.</p>\n<p>2631. Le dentiste doit marcher légèrement s&#8217;il veut gagner et fidéliser ses clients. Son grand avantage est le mal de dents, un gros bâton effectivement.</p>\n<p>2632. Hé, perdant ! Ne saviez-vous pas que comme la nuit précède le jour, la moitié vide d&#8217;un verre doit précéder la pleine ?</p>\n<p>2633. Ne saviez-vous pas que de même que Dieu crée les ténèbres avant la lumière, et la nuit avant le jour, ainsi, à moins qu&#8217;il n&#8217;y ait un verre à moitié vide, il n&#8217;y a pas de Dieu ?</p>\n<p>2634. Acceptez vos pertes &#8211; elles ne sont pas seulement bonnes pour vous, elles sont parfaitement nécessaires.</p>\n<p>2635. Il ne s&#8217;agit pas de sacrifier nos biens mais nous-mêmes. Caïn a offert un sacrifice mais Abel s&#8217;est offert lui-même.</p>\n<p>2636. C&#8217;est marrant comme d&#8217;un côté, l&#8217;amour, le pardon, la bonne volonté, la sympathie et la miséricorde peuvent subvertir la justice et tuer tandis que de l&#8217;autre, un jugement sévère peut démontrer l&#8217;amour, rendre justice et préserver la vie.</p>\n<p>2637. Gardez l&#8217;humeur de tout votre être. L&#8217;humeur peut déterminer l&#8217;issue de nombreuses et grandes choses.</p>\n<p>2638. De nombreux facteurs peuvent déterminer l&#8217;humeur ; essayez de les juger avant l&#8217;humeur.</p>\n<p>2639. Prêtez attention à votre prochain ; il peut avoir un meilleur jugement que le vôtre sur une question.</p>\n<p>2640. Méfiez-vous du jugement de votre prochain; il peut ne pas savoir ce qui est nécessaire.</p>\n<p>2641. Déterminez votre humeur par de nombreuses influences telles que votre santé, la météo, le repos, l&#8217;alimentation, les pensées, l&#8217;attitude et la compagnie.</p>\n<p>2642. Je trouve que plus je suis silencieux, plus j&#8217;ai l&#8217;air sage, et le bonus c&#8217;est que moins j&#8217;en dis, plus je suis sage.</p>\n<p>2643. Ce n&#8217;est pas difficile d&#8217;être béni ; sois simplement bon et fais ce qui est juste.</p>\n<p>2644. Il y a une différence notable entre imposer le respect et l&#8217;exiger. S’il est dû, il sera là ; s&#8217;il n&#8217;est pas dû, aucune force ne le fera arriver.</p>\n<p>2645. Si je me trompe, le Seigneur me corrigera ; si je suis lésé, le Seigneur vous corrigera.</p>\n<p>2646. Si vous enviez votre frère, vous n&#8217;apprécierez pas ce qui vous appartient.</p>\n<p>2647. Épargner les déchets, refuser de les reconnaître comme des déchets, peut être le plus grand des déchets.</p>\n<p>2648. Oublier est humain ; pardonner est Divin.</p>\n<p>2649. Un homme peut oublier mais il ne pardonnera pas ; Dieu pardonnera bien qu&#8217;Il n&#8217;oublie jamais.</p>\n<p>2650. De même qu&#8217;une noix ne vient pas sans coque ou un grain sans ivraie, de même le bon ne vient pas sans le mauvais ; il n&#8217;y a pas d&#8217;autre façon.</p>\n<p>2651. De même que nous devons tous dormir pour être éveillés, ainsi nous devons souffrir le mal pour être bon.</p>\n<p>2652. Tout comme le mal peut être notre ami, ainsi le bien peut être notre ennemi.</p>\n<p>2653. Le mal et le bien sont attachés à la hanche, à l&#8217;épaule et à la tête ; ils ne peuvent pas être séparés et l&#8217;un ne peut exister sans l&#8217;autre.</p>\n<p>2654. Refusez de payer le prix et vous ne recevrez pas la marchandise ; lamentez-vous sur le prix que vous payez et vous ne l’apprécierez pas ; languissez-vous du mal et vous perdez le bien.</p>\n<p>2655. Reconnaissez la valeur du prix et vous entrez dans une glorieuse gratitude.</p>\n<p>2656. Ce n&#8217;est qu&#8217;en embrassant la mort que l&#8217;on peut jouir de la victoire.</p>\n<p>2657. Telle une tempête violente et destructrice, comme la puissance des conséquences maléfiques est étonnante.</p>\n<p>2658. Tout comme il n&#8217;y a pas de jour sans nuit et pas de lumière sans ténèbres, ainsi, il n’y a pas de gain sans perte, et pas de victoire sans échec.</p>\n<p>2659. Les ennemis du roi se font eux-mêmes dix fois le mal qu&#8217;ils lui font.</p>\n<p>2660. Il y a l’humilité vraie de la volonté de respecter la Vérité de n&#8217;importe quel côté et de ne pas s&#8217;estimer au-dessus des autres.</p>\n<p>2661. Tout le mal qui se présente à nous, soit nous en avons besoin soit nous le méritons, ou les deux.</p>\n<p>2662. Comme les nuages et la fumée peuvent se ressembler, il en va de même pour ceux qui n’osent pas prendre parti et les artisans de la paix, mais ils sont tellement différents.</p>\n<p>2663. En plaçant notre confiance dans les hommes, nous soupirons et mourons ; en croyant Dieu, nous survivons et prospérons.</p>\n<p>2664. Quand quelqu&#8217;un est prêt à sacrifier ce qui est pour lui de plus grande valeur pour le bien de son prochain, il franchit les portes de la victoire et pénètre sur les parvis de la gloire.</p>\n<p>2665. S&#8217;attendre au payement avant le service, c&#8217;est s&#8217;attendre à la lumière avant le lever du soleil.</p>\n<p>2666. S’attendre à l&#8217;appréciation avant le mérite, c&#8217;est s&#8217;attendre à de l&#8217;eau sans pluie.</p>\n<p>2667. L&#8217;huile oint pour l’élection à la mort mais le feu oint au pouvoir invulnérable. Seulement par le feu et la mort y a-t-il résurrection. Seulement par la résurrection y a-t-il une victoire certaine.</p>\n<p>2668. C&#8217;est surprenant ce qu&#8217;on peut trouver quand on le cherche, surtout quand d&#8217;autres disent qu&#8217;il n&#8217;y a rien à trouver.</p>\n<p>2669. Lorsque ce monde se regroupe, il devient plus fort, et lorsqu&#8217;il se disperse, il s&#8217;affaiblit. Quand les saints se regroupent, ils s&#8217;affaiblissent ; quand ils se dispersent, leur force augmente.</p>\n<p>2670. Un peu de sel fait toute la différence et un peu de souillure détruit tout.</p>\n<p>2671. Il a été dit : « Vivre et laisser vivre », mais je dis : « Laissez vivre et vivre. »</p>\n<p>2672. « Écoutez votre corps ; il sait ce dont il a besoin mieux que quiconque ; donnez-lui ce qu&#8217;il demande », disent ceux qui recherchent la santé et le bien-être. Prenez garde, le corps vous dit non seulement ce dont il a besoin mais aussi ce qu&#8217;il veut.</p>\n<p>2673. Pouvez-vous distinguer la différence ? Ou pensez-vous que le corps n&#8217;est qu&#8217;honnête et vertueux dans toutes ses voies, ne cherchant que ce qui est bon ?</p>\n<p>2674. Ceux qui offrent leurs holocaustes au Seigneur par nous peuvent aller ailleurs s&#8217;ils se soucient de savoir où la fumée va.</p>\n<p>2675. La gloire ne fait point acception de personne, à l&#8217;exception de celui qui la recherche.</p>\n<p>2676. Il n&#8217;y a pas de plus grande solitude qu&#8217;avec celui qui se retrouve seul.</p>\n<p>2677. Les pertes sont des gains déguisés qui attendent leur heure.</p>\n<p>2678. Les amis ne sont pas bon marché ; il n&#8217;y a rien de plus cher ou de plus rare.</p>\n<p>2679. Les ennemis coûtent 10 centimes la douzaine ; il n&#8217;y a rien de moins cher ou de plus abondant.</p>\n<p>2680. Il y a ceux qui confessent leurs péchés avec la présomption qu&#8217;ils seront pardonnés parce qu&#8217;ils les ont confessés.</p>\n<p>2681. Le sacrifice de Caïn est en vue de recevoir l&#8217;appréciation de Dieu mais l&#8217;offrande d&#8217;Abel est en vue de L&#8217;apprécier Lui</p>\n<p>2682. Celui qui réfléchit alors qu’il parle doit être plus apprécié que celui qui a réfléchi, de même que les fruits de saison sont plus agréables que les fruits hors saison.</p>\n<p>2683. L&#8217;esprit d&#8217;Abel vient pour faire confiance à Dieu contre les dommages alors que l&#8217;esprit de Caïn vient pour les empêcher.</p>\n<p>2684. Caïn vient pour soudoyer et flatter Dieu tandis qu&#8217;Abel vient avec actions de grâces.</p>\n<p>2685. Caïn vient pour obtenir tandis qu&#8217;Abel vient donner.</p>\n<p>2686. Le but du culte religieux formel aujourd&#8217;hui est de feindre la fidélité à Dieu, mais le vrai culte spirituel démontre la fidélité.</p>\n<p>2687. La semence de Caïn méprise à mort la vie juste de la foi, la semence de la gloire à venir.</p>\n<p>2688. La gratitude vaut mieux que le regret et la reconnaissance que l&#8217;assurance.</p>\n<p>2689. Les paroles d&#8217;un tyran cupide affligent un serviteur, mais les lèvres d&#8217;un roi sage ravissent l&#8217;âme.</p>\n<p>2690. Ceux qui reconnaissent leur culpabilité échappent aux conséquences et ceux qui justifient leur erreur ne récoltent aucune récompense.</p>\n<p>2691. Les chercheurs de gloire sont obligés de prendre une place moindre et de créer leur propre humiliation, mais ceux qui honorent la justice et la vérité sont richement récompensés.</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/french/proverbes-2251-2500_french.htm\"><strong>&lt;&lt; PREVIOUS</strong></a>                             <strong>NEXT &gt;&gt;<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Retour à la liste des </strong><a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/french/index.htm\"><strong>articles disponibles en français</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>\n<!-- relpost-thumb-wrapper --><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><!-- filter-class --><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><!-- relpost-block-container --><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/french/proverbes-2001-2250.htm\"class=\"relpost-block-single\" ><div class=\"relpost-custom-block-single\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 275px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"<b>Proverbes 2001-2250</b>\"  style=\"background: transparent url(https://www.thepathoftruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/w1-small.png) no-repeat scroll 0% 0%; width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-single-text\"  style=\"font-family: Helvetica;  font-size: 12px;  color: #333333;\"><b>Proverbes 2001-2250</b><br/>\r\n\r\nEnglish – French\r\n« Et de plus, parce que le prédicateur était sage, il a encore enseigné la connaissance au peuple; et il a pesé et sondé, et mis en ordre beaucoup de proverbes.

I don&#8217;t know that you were very clear, or I just missed it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Do you believe the story of Noah, THE FLOOD, and the ark is mythological (fictional), merely an allegory of human gestation, or do you believe it to be a record of an actual, historical event, which nonetheless represented another aspect or &#8220;department&#8221; of reality, what I would call &#8220;creation&#8221;?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Of course, you likely know where I stand on these matters but I&#8217;d like to hear where you stand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">When I have confirmation from you on these points, I&#8217;d like to send you a very brief summation of my thoughts on </span><em style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Four.Five</em><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">However, I&#8217;d like to converse by email, if you don&#8217;t mind.

I am open to discussion but only if it does not wander off into issues of personal faith. Also, I do not wish to indulge in written exchanges for lack of time. However, I do not mind receiving your comments and conversing by telephone.</span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #0000ff; ;background: transparent;\">Victor Hafichuk</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">I&#8217;ve little doubt my letter will take up less of your time than would a phone call. I would prefer to put it on paper for the advantage of a clearer understanding of who said what and in what context; all can be easily verified, unless audio-recorded, of course. I also find that people often don&#8217;t give others a chance to complete their thoughts or messages are unclear and the reader is able to review before responding, which also saves time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">I am much better on paper than in speech, as you may know [</span><span style=\"color: #833c0b; ;background: transparent;\">not that I’m anything unusual as a writer</span><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">].

The two had repeatedly gone public with their concerns about deficiencies in Canada’s drug approval process.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">In 1998, they testified before a Senate committee that they were being pressured to approve Recombinant Bovine Somatotropin (rBST), a controversial growth hormone intended to boost milk production in dairy cattle.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">In its decision, the PSLREB overturned Haydon’s dismissal and substituted a 20-day suspension instead.

But the board’s decision to overturn her 10-day suspension and rule out consideration of a five-day suspension in 2001 meant there was no longer any discipline on her record, Mackenzie said.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">“I find that in light of the lack of a prior record and Dr. Haydon’s length of service, a suspension of 20 days would have been an appropriate disciplinary sanction for her acts of insubordination.”</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Though Haydon’s dismissal was overturned, the issue of what constitutes an appropriate remedy was not addressed during the tribunal’s hearing. Mackenzie said he would leave that to the parties to resolve, but will retain jurisdiction in case they can’t agree.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">While the board overturned Chopra’s 20-day suspension, his record still contained earlier five- and 10-day suspensions, the tribunal decision says, both of which were upheld by the Federal Court.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">“The 10-day suspension was for insubordination and was similar to the misconduct the employer relied on for terminating his employment,” Mackenzie observed.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Chopra behaviour didn’t improve after the 10-day suspension, he noted, nor did he admit to any errors in his behaviour at the tribunal’s hearing into the grievances.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">“Dr. Chopra broke the bond of trust with the employer,” the tribunal says in its decision. In view of his attitude and failure to respond to lesser discipline, reinstatement now would vindicate his actions and invite a repetition, it concludes.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Despite the failure to win reinstatement for Chopra, PIPSC issued a media release Wednesday describing the tribunal’s decision as a “major victory.”</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">“Dr. Haydon has won the right to return to work and most of Dr. Chopra’s discipline has been overturned,” Debi Daviau, the president of PIPSC, said in the release. “That in itself is a testament to the justice of their cause and the perseverance they and their union have shown.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">“While we are obviously disappointed the board did not also agree to overturn the dismissal of Dr. Chopra, we are glad to see most of the discipline that was imposed on him overturned and will be reviewing the board’s decision to determine whether or not to challenge.”</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">In a statement Wednesday, Health Canada said it is reviewing the tribunal’s decision, but said “it would be premature to provide comments pending a detailed review.” </span><br />\n<a href=\"mailto:dbutler@postmedia.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dbutler@postmedia.com</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/ButlerDon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">twitter.com/ButlerDon</a><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\"> </span><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/325656180/Chopra-Haydon-Decision-September-22-2016#from_embed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chopra Haydon Decision, September 22, 2016</a><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\"> by </span><a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/user/48609711/Ottawa-Citizen#from_embed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ottawa Citizen</a><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\"> on Scribd </span><strong style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">END OF ARTICLE</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Dr. Chopra, in response to the judgment, you said on September 29th: </span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #0000ff; ;background: transparent;\">Shiv Chopra</strong><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\"> Don&#8217;t know why people are congratulating me.

I have a sure-fire solution to your problem of not receiving a satisfactory vindication, Shiv. I ask you to forgive your adversaries, those who have wronged you. Put away your pride and resultant bitterness, which you say you don’t have, though it’s evident to others. “</span><em style=\"color: #993300; ;background: transparent;\">You want justice?

It won’t work, Shiv. You apparently disagree with the Christian-Judeo Theistic moral ethic so let me put the same truth and principles in other terms I suspect you might be more inclined to agree with:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">You know of and agree on the principle of Karma. “What goes around, comes around.” There it is. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">I’ve learned the truth and inestimable value of the knowledge of the meaning of this proverb found in the Scripture you’ve studied:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">“As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come” (Proverbs 26:2 KJV).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">This is nothing a “big bang” or unintelligent matter can perform by accident repeatedly in all aspects of life. It takes Intelligence with a Perfect Sense of Justice to accomplish. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Whatever we suffer, we either need or deserve. That’s how it is. Our Sovereign Creator is neither stupid nor impotent, and never asleep. He runs the entire show and He knows what He’s doing. When we learn to take responsibility for those things that come upon us &#8211; that is when true freedom comes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">“You shall know the Truth and the Truth will make you free,” said Jesus Christ, Lord of all. And I don’t care if Confucius or Buddha or anyone else spoke this Truth, as well.

Chopra shows that the timings and elements of Noah, the flood, and the ark event are a wonderful representation in scientific terms and details of the conception, gestation, and birth of a human being.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">It’s interesting how while Dr. Chopra can approach the subject with an intellect for calculations and speculation, he still remains an atheist, or, if he believes in the existence of a Supreme Being or First Cause at all, he certainly fails to acknowledge Him as the Creator, or realize that everything in existence did not come to be by cross-species evolution. Most importantly, he doesn’t realize the Divinity of the Present Living Personal Lord and Savior of all mankind, Jesus Christ, Engineer and Maintainer of All Things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">It seems Shiv Chopra still thinks the story of Noah is a myth or allegory, notwithstanding the Genesis record before and after the story, Noah’s genealogy included, and of the reference to him by Jesus Christ and His disciples as a historical person, as recorded in the New Testament. All this in spite of the fact that Shiv seems to believe that the books of the Old and New Testaments must be studied as a whole because of their unity with nature and purpose. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">And what should make Dr. Chopra assume that the rest of Genesis and even the remainder of the Bible is not accurate if the first chapters of Genesis are as accurate as he seems to believe they are, so much so that he prides himself in his discoveries of numerous scientific facts allegorically related in the account of Noah?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">My summation of where Chopra is at and addressed to him publicly, as his book is public:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Shiv Chopra, do you believe the entire Book of Genesis is essentially true or not? According to your approach to Genesis chapters one through nine, there’s contradiction in your thinking. You don’t seem to recognize that if the statistics you comment on there are so accurate in detail, as “proven” by your reasoning and deduction, then you should be quite prepared to acknowledge the veracity of the claims the entire Book of Genesis makes. And what about the rest of the Bible that serves to expand on the Genesis record?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">For example, I take it you are a macro-evolutionist. Am I right on that? I asked you this question and you declined to respond. I assume this is because you know there would be a difference between us and you didn’t care for what I had to offer you, seeing I believe in creation and micro-evolution only, which is perfectly reasonable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Both I and the Book of Genesis contradict your apparent theory of macro-evolution, which is logically unreasonable, untenable and frankly, “a horse’s ass.” I find no lie so confounding, illogical and ludicrous as that of evolution. Yet, highly educated and intelligent men espouse it as Gospel truth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">For definition of evolution terms, I Googled and randomly refer to </span><a href=\"http://www.pravdareport.com/science/mysteries/01-11-2010/115603-two_kinds_evolution-0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.pravdareport.com/science/mysteries/01-11-2010/115603-two_kinds_evolution-0/</a><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">“Many in society are not aware of the difference between micro-evolution and macro-evolution. Micro-evolution is true science and it involves biological variations within a ‘kind’ such as varieties of dogs, cats, horses, cows, etc. Charles Darwin assumed that because micro-evolution occurs in nature that macro-evolution (biological variations across kinds) would also be possible if given enough time.” END QUOTE</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">What you seem to glaringly miss in Genesis is that it authoritatively declares that all things are begotten by like kind and never descend from unlike species. The chapters your study is based on do declare:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">“And God said, Let the earth bring forth tender sprouts (the herb seeding seed and the fruit tree producing fruit </span><strong style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\"><em>after its kind</em></strong><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">, whose seed is in itself) upon the earth; and it was so.

Yet you speak as one who understands some of those facts and, furthermore, insist on having credibility while dismissing the simple proofs of your error.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">What must happen is that you come to meet the Owner, Builder, and Resident of that building and be invited in as a guest to realize the glorious wonder of what you’ve had a tiny glimpse of by your faulty perception and limited reasoning powers. To this wonderful end is the Genesis account written, inspired by Our Creator to inform the creature He’s creating of what He is doing as He forms him in His image.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">There’s only one way a man can come to the Father (God) and that is to humble himself through faith in His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, Who, by the way, didn’t fail, as you presumptuously surmise. He accomplished what He was appointed to do, which was to lay down His life and take it up again that mankind might ultimately be reconciled to, and have glorious fellowship with, God. Like begets like: Life and Truth beget Life. Death and lies can only produce destruction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Jesus Christ, God’s Only Begotten Son, overcame death and the powers of hell and darkness &#8211; where you and multitudes currently reside. His work needs only be fully manifest at His appointed time. Those who have been delivered from darkness know very well Who Jesus Christ is, what He has done, is doing, and will do in perfect success with the culmination of the ages. That culmination is now upon us, as prophesied in the Bible you don’t comprehend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">The Son, by the predeterminate counsel and foreknowledge of God, voluntarily sacrificed His earthly life. As a kernel of wheat, He was sown (buried) and raised up again after three days to give us the Way, the Truth and the Life, all of which He Is, that we might enjoy fellowship and unity with Him and the Father. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">He lives, Shiv; He lives! I and those with me have received His Spirit and Life as have many others over the millennia, thus making us all true brothers and sisters together in Him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">We saints all know THE FLOOD occurred in reality, that there was a man Noah, who had a wife and three sons who were married, and who had children. These and a sampling of creatures were spared in the flood by building an ark according to God’s instruction. From these, the earth was replenished when the waters receded and they abandoned the ark on the mountains of Ararat, a specific historical and geographical location. Noah’s genealogy, before and after, is on record in both the Old and New Testaments, a record of real people whose descendants populate the earth today.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Now think of how marvelous God’s works are, past mortal’s comprehension, that He should design an event in detail as that of Noah, the ark, and the flood to parallel the conception, gestation and embryological development of the creature He is in process of creating in His own image (by the way, there are innumerable detailed Scriptural and creation parallels such as the one you’re alerted to). And you, Dr. Shiv Chopra, are, by God’s unmerited favor, witness to that bit of information, not because of carnal intelligence, but by His grace.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Shiv, as intelligent as you are, you won’t understand or receive what I’m saying because these things are spiritual and can only be apprehended by God’s grace and sovereign will. I couldn’t come to understand them by myself and don’t take any credit. One day, you’ll meet your Maker as I did, and be humbled before Him, recognizing your utter unworthiness, even depravity, as is common to all men separated from God and without Christ. Your wisdom and knowledge will be confounded.

My name is Justin and i have been walking with the Lord for 16 years now and i just discovered your website today. My testimony is very similar to your story in that i repented with my whole heart 16 years ago and have held fast to that repentance and walked with the Spirit for all of these years and have been shown many of the same fallacies of the modern day Christian church as well as the antichrist spirit which leads them. \r\n\r\nI would love to write you another email soon and share/fellowship with you in regard to my walk/sufferings with the Lord all of these many years. I wrote you today specifically to see if you would mind answering a question for me about the Baptism in the Holy Ghost. I was shown through revelation of the Promise of the Father many years ago, probably about 9 years ago. I have been seeking this infilling and experience ever since. Carrying my cross and dying to self in the process. \r\n\r\nMy question is, when you received the Spirit and later spoke in tongues, did the tongues come forth as the Spirit gave utterance? Or was it something that you had to do yourself in order to speak in tongues? I ask because in my younger years in the Lord i was around American churches and people tried to instruct me on how to speak in tongues, they would say repeat the sounds i am making...gibberish, Or say these syllables and now you ar...</div></div></a><a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/letters/godfidence-from-the-man-of-sin.htm\"class=\"relpost-block-single\" ><div class=\"relpost-custom-block-single\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 275px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"<b>Ungodly Confidence From the Man of Sin</b>\"  style=\"background: transparent url(https://www.thepathoftruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/w1-small.png) no-repeat scroll 0% 0%; width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-single-text\"  style=\"font-family: Helvetica;  font-size: 12px;  color: #333333;\"><b>Ungodly Confidence From the Man of Sin</b><br/>From: Theresa \r\nTo: The Path of Truth \r\nSent: Sunday, November 06, 2016 10:34 PM\r\nSubject: Todd White?\r\n\r\n“There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:”\r\n\r\nRomans 8:1-3 KJV\r\n\r\nhttp://bible.com/1/rom.8.1-3.kjv\r\n\r\nOk so seen ur argument on Todd White. I get curious if he is false prophet but I am curious what Bible u r reading from too. What is MKJV? \r\n\r\nAnd why such harsh judgement of a set free man. He is not promoting God in a bold way. God shows up in miraculous ways when you r bold and you step out of your comfort zone. I seen it for myself. Holy Spirit can lead you into incredible situations. \r\n\r\nGod does love us all. We r all sinners but we can be saved by grace. \r\n\r\nNone of us are perfect til Heaven. I believe Todd White is definitely being used of God. Very rare to have bold people like him. Peter was greatly used of God and he denied Christ at one time. God can use any of us, Christian or not for his glory. \r\n\r\nYou sound like you r not set free yourself.

Pourquoi est-il si aveugle, si insensible à la menace vicieuse qui le regarde en face ? Pourquoi ne peut-il voir l’évidence ? La réponse est le péché. Le péché désensibilise, aveugle, assourdit, et endort. Plus spécifiquement, plus d’un milliard de personnes ont pris sur elles le Nom du Seigneur Jésus-Christ en vain. Ils ont professé croire en Lui, L’aimer et L’adorer, mais leurs cœurs sont loin de Lui, et ils s’en fichent.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">“L’hypocrisie les enveloppe d’un grand manteau à capuche, de la tête aux pieds.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">De par le monde, partout où l&#8217;on trouve le Nom de Jésus-Christ utilisé, il y a tous les péchés connus de l’homme mis en pratique. Ceux qui commettent les pires violations sont les plus religieux, les plus « pieux ». Plus ils sont religieux, pires ils sont. L’hypocrisie les enveloppe d’un grand manteau à capuche, de la tête aux pieds. Ils pèchent de toutes les manières, dans l’esprit et le cœur, si pas dans la chair, dans l’adultère, la fornication, l’homosexualité, la pédophilie, la pornographie, les perversions sexuelles de toutes sortes, les mensonges, la fraude, le vol, les blasphèmes, les drogues, l’ivresse, la tyrannie, le meurtre, le génocide, le chantage, la traîtrise, la destruction, l’idolâtrie, la pollution, et toute sorte d’iniquité connue de l’homme. Ils prétendent que leurs péchés sont « sous le sang », pardonnés par Dieu parce que le Christ est mort sur la croix pour eux. Au lieu de « Mangez, buvez et soyez joyeux, car demain nous mourrons », la devise est, « Mangez, buvez, soyez joyeux, et faites tout ce qu’il vous plaît, car l’addition est payée, et nous vivrons éternellement ». L’ancienne devise était déjà suffisamment malfaisante ; la dernière l’est encore davantage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Nous venons d’assister à la destruction de la Nouvelle-Orléans et des zones alentours, qui est venue à cause du crime et de la débauche, tolérés et approuvés par l’Amérique et le monde. Et puis voilà que le festival impie de Mardi Gras continue. Apprennent-ils ? De toute évidence, ils ne le font pas. Mais qui le fait ? Permettez-moi de demander aux fans des Jeux Olympiques. Au moment où j’écris, le monde met en scène les Jeux Olympiques de Turin, en Italie. Ici nous avons une délectation et une exaltation de la chair. Donc vous pouvez skier jusqu’au bas d’une pente à une super vitesse, surpassant tous les autres. Alors quoi ? Vous passez votre jeunesse à vous entraîner pour cela, et dans quelques années, vous ne serez plus capable de le faire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Bien que vous soyez le plus rapide, ou le plus fort, ou le mieux entraîné, excellez-vous dans les vertus importantes pour Dieu ? Goliath était un guerrier géant, effrayant toute l’armée israélite. À quoi ça a servi ? David était-il aussi grand et aussi fort ? La force de David était dans sa foi en Dieu, dans son désir de justice. Ses forces divines ont vaincu les forces de la chair. Goliath, le puissant champion olympique, mordit la poussière. Jésus-Christ, le Messie, Le Sauveur du monde, devint connu sous le nom du « Fils de David ».</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Alors que les Jeux Olympiques sont une démonstration de force et d’habileté charnelles et terrestres, Dieu recherche la foi authentique et la sainteté. Les Jeux Olympiques sont-ils meilleurs que le Mardi Gras ? Ne sont-ils pas tous deux le produit de la chair, qui, selon la Parole de Dieu, est inimitié contre Lui ? Comment se fait-il que le monde soit si déterminé à dépenser des centaines de millions de dollars et des heures d’énergie à frimer, quand il y a des millions de personnes dans le besoin mourant de faim, des sans-abris, et des millions de victimes mourant du sida ? Comment se fait-il que le monde considère qu’un sprint sur 100 mètres en 9,7 secondes soit plus important que d’aider son prochain ?

Qu’est-ce qu’une concurrence loyale ? Les gens peuvent tricher et s’en tirer, gagner des médailles sans vrai mérite. Peut-on être sûr que les gagnants sont justes et honnêtes ? Même s’ils ne trichent pas, qu’en est-il de l’attitude ? Pouvons-nous dire qui a eu la meilleure attitude, dont nous proclamons hypocritement qu’elle est la plus importante ? Les médailles sont-elles attribuées pour la bonne attitude ou la foi, sans laquelle, la Bible dit, il est impossible de plaire à Dieu ?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Qu’est-ce qui est équitable ? Les gens viennent d’horizons divers de circonstances et de conditions déterminantes. Qu’en est-il de la race ? Les noirs ne sont-ils pas supérieurs dans certaines capacités physiques, et donc dans la performance de nombreux sports ? Comment est-il alors juste d’opposer un caucasien à un noir ? Combien souvent voit-on un blanc champion du monde de boxe ou au sprint ? Qu’est-ce qui est équitable ?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Se pourrait-il qu&#8217;Israël, la nation choisie de Dieu, ait été châtiée par Lui à Munich, plus que d’autres nations, parce que Dieu n’est pas content qu&#8217;Israël participe aux activités païennes ?

Certainement !</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Alors que l’on peut tricher dans le sport, l’on ne peut pas tricher dans la foi. La foi produit les fruits conformes à sa force et à sa qualité. L’esprit et l&#8217;œuvre des Jeux Olympiques sont en abomination à Dieu. Le tout est une mascarade, une vanité aux proportions extrêmes. Cela est peu différent de la débauche du Mardi Gras, un événement identifié à l’adoration de Dieu, un événement religieux fabriqué et tacitement sanctionné par l&#8217;Église catholique romaine.

Il y a de la violence de tous côtés, de toutes parts, et les gens aiment qu’il en soit ainsi. Cela n’est pas différent de ce qu’il en était au temps de Noé. Le mot « violence » dans la Genèse signifie « gain injuste ». Cela vous semble-t-il familier ?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Vient le jugement et le fléau de Dieu, s’approchant rapidement, furtivement, trompeusement, avec détermination, de façon meurtrière, impitoyablement, sans compromis, avec un zèle hors du commun ; le genre qui possède ceux qui accompliraient leur mission voulue de verser avec joie leur propre sang si nécessaire. Ce sont des gens vicieux dont le but n’est rien moins que la domination totale du monde. Dans leurs esprits, ils ne peuvent pas perdre. S’ils vivent, ils conquièrent et pillent ; s’ils meurent, ils entrent dans la félicité avec tous les désirs lascifs comblés… de magnifiques jardins, du vin, des dîners, des femmes et des chants. Dans la vie, ils ont les louanges de leur peuple et de leurs chefs spirituels. Dans la mort, ils ont leurs vierges, leurs banquets, et leur félicité éternelle. Comment peuvent-ils perdre ? Je dis cela avec ironie. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Comment ceux qui se tiennent de l’autre côté peuvent-ils gagner ? Craignant pour leurs vies, leurs conforts, leurs droits, et leurs privilèges, les personnes confrontées n’ont plus que trois choix : devenir musulman, devenir l’esclave d’un musulman, ou mourir. Il n’y a pas d’autre alternative.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Eh bien, leur dieu et leur prophète ne sont-ils pas gentils, pacifiques, et aimants ? Les occidentaux n’ont-ils aucune idée de ce que le Coran (Qur’an) enseigne ? La religion musulmane est-elle effectivement une religion d’amour et de paix comme le prétendent les musulmans ? (Voir </span><a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/the-issues-of-life/the-muslim-scourge.htm#appendix\">Annexe</a> <span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">et</span> <a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/falsehood-exposed/islam/islam-neither-good-nor-godly.htm\">L’islam : ni bon ni pieux</a> <em style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">&#8211; seulement disponible en anglais</em><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">) Permettez-moi de vous déclarer solennellement aujourd’hui que le Coran est en parfaite inimitié avec la Bible et représente tout sauf la paix et l’amour. Ne me croyez pas sur parole. Lisez-le. Le Coran s’oppose diamétralement au “gens du Livre (la Bible),” c’est-à-dire les juifs et les chrétiens. Le Coran prêche la conquête par l’épée. Il enseigne la rupture des contrats et des accords, avec l’approbation d’Allah, si ces accords ont été passés avec des infidèles, c’est-à-dire, des non-musulmans, ce qui signifie que s’ils signent un contrat avec vous, et que vous avez respecté votre part du marché, ils n’ont pas à respecter la leur. Commode ? C’est sûr ! Surtout quand leur dieu approuve. Ils partent avec les biens gratuits et la conscience tranquille.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Les musulmans se sont engagés à l&#8217;assujettissement ou à l’éradication des « gens du samedi » et des « gens du dimanche ». Tous ceux qui nomment le Nom de Christ ou le Dieu des juifs sont des infidèles pour les musulmans, ainsi que tous les autres non-musulmans, mais spécialement les « chrétiens » et les juifs. Ils sont obligés de s’opposer à tous les infidèles et même de les tuer, si nécessaire. Ils ont l’intention de le faire. Vous dites, « Ce sont les extrémistes, dont il n’y en a que peu ». En réponse, je vous demande, « Ne lisent-ils pas tous le même Coran ? » Oui, ils le font, et le Coran enseigne précisément ces choses que les extrémistes font. Les extrémistes sont plus fidèles au Coran que les « modérés » ne le sont. De plus, quand ces passages sont pointés dans le Coran par les puissants ayatollahs et mollahs, les jeunes modérés sont enclins à faire leur devoir et à devenir « extrémistes », tout spécialement avec les prétendues récompenses qui leur sont offertes ou promises.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">“ Les musulmans sont là à cause des péchés de l’Occident et du christianisme nominal.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Regardez les fruits. Comment se fait-il que les « extrémistes » puissent être aussi présents partout dans le monde en grand nombre, s’ils sont si peu ? Où voit-on des juifs et des chrétiens se faire exploser et brûler des mosquées ? Où voit-on des lois élaborées dans les pays occidentaux pour interdire ou restreindre la religion musulmane ? Les chrétiens nominaux sont confrontés à toutes sortes de châtiment, y compris la mort, pour avoir prêché et fait du prosélytisme dans les pays gouvernés par les musulmans. Partout dans le monde, particulièrement en Afrique, dans les pays musulmans, et en Asie, ils sont massacrés, et les églises et les synagogues sont détruites. Les occidentaux sont kidnappés, détenus en échange d’une rançon, et décapités.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Y-a-t-il des protestations et des manifestations de l’Occident contre de telles atrocités ? Pas du tout. Dessinez une bête caricature, et les musulmans se révoltent, brûlent des ambassades et tuent partout dans le monde. Si les musulmans décapitent publiquement quelques occidentaux, l’Occident est apeuré, ferme les yeux, essaye d’apaiser et de faire des compromis, ou essaye de raisonner et de faire la paix. Réussit-il dans son approche ? Si la réponse est « oui », alors pourquoi la menace musulmane augmente-t-elle en intensité ? Pourquoi les tours jumelles ne sont-elles plus ? Pourquoi l’Iran et d’autres pays, organisations et individus musulmans prêchent-ils la mort et la destruction ? Comment se fait-il que des citoyens britanniques locaux de religion musulmane soient prêts et capables de tuer leurs compatriotes britanniques sans discrimination, peu importe leur âge, sexe, religion ou tout autre facteur ? Comment se fait-il qu’ils déclarent publiquement la haine et la mort pour Israël et l’Amérique ? Voit-t-on des américains et des juifs danser et se déchaîner dans les rues, réclamant en criant le sang d’un dessinateur et de son pays, et de tous les pays sympathisants au sien ?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Pourquoi les musulmans viennent-ils, et ont-ils maintenant passé la porte ? Ils sont ici à cause des péchés de l’Occident et à cause des péchés du christianisme nominal. C’est le jugement de Dieu. Mieux vaut être chaud ou froid que d’être tiède, dit Jésus. Les musulmans sont d’un froid glacial, prétendant être bouillants, et ils annihileront les tièdes qui n&#8217;ont pas les tripes pour le bien. Lorsque nous essayons de prêcher la vérité aux gens sur notre site Web et dans </span><a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/the-issues-of-life/index.htm\">Les enjeux de la vie</a> <span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">(</span><em style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">seulement disponible en anglais</em><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">), nous sommes moqués, insultés, méprisés, maudits, haïs, abusés, censurés, menacés, rejetés, détestés et condamnés. La majorité de ceux à qui nous envoyons des courriels le font. Nous savons que nous prêchons la vérité et le chemin vers la vie. Nous savons que nous faisons la volonté de Dieu. Nous savons que nous prêchons, non pour condamner, bien que notre prédication condamne ceux qui s&#8217;accrochent à leurs ténèbres et leurs péchés. Nous prêchons pour avertir, pour sauver, et pour empêcher ce qui arrivera s’ils n’écoutent pas. Ils n’écoutent pas.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">“La guerre, le terrorisme, la souffrance, et la mort sont sur les marches de l’Amérique.”</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">L’Amérique du Nord a connu une paix relative dans son histoire récente. Oui, elle s’est battue dans les grandes guerres, en Corée, au Vietnam, au Moyen-Orient, et un peu dans d’autres endroits, mais son propre sol est resté relativement paisible. Dieu a été miséricordieux. Mais Il a fini de fermer les yeux. Qui s’échappera ? Maintenant, nous avons la cérémonie d’allumage des torches des tours jumelles de la grande ville des États-Unis, New York, pour commencer l’effusion de sang et la mise à feu de l’Amérique (le Canada inclus).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Vous ne pouvez imaginer que cela se produise, n’est-ce pas ? Je suis désolé d’être le porteur de nouvelles qui ne sont pas plaisantes du tout. Ce sont d’horribles nouvelles. C’est proche des pires nouvelles que vous auriez envie recevoir. La guerre, le terrorisme, la souffrance, et la mort sont sur les marches de l’Amérique. L’Europe, aussi, est à l’agenda. Prenez les bombes en Espagne et en Angleterre, et les émeutes de Paris et l’attaque de 2015, par exemple. Dieu ne ferme plus les yeux sur la méchanceté, sur la dureté de cœur des soi-disant chrétiens aimant Dieu, des athées, des humanistes, des adeptes du New Age, des œcuménistes, des catholiques, des mormons, des « témoins de Jéhovah », des adventistes du septième jour, des socialistes, des démocrates, des évolutionnistes, et de tout autre type d’entité suffisante, mal informée, volontairement ignorante et contraire à Dieu. L’église prostituée est sur le point de subir, et subit déjà, la correction de sa vie. Croiriez-vous la destruction ?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Une question logique se forme : si le fléau musulman est dirigé vers les pécheurs, alors pourquoi la plus grande véhémence est-elle concentrée sur les juifs ? Sont-ils les plus grands pécheurs de tous ? Non, et oui. D’une part, nous sommes coupables du sang de Jésus-Christ, le gentil comme le juif. Nous sommes tous pécheurs et avons été jugés coupables par Dieu. Les juifs sont coupables, tout comme Luther et Hitler l’ont dit, mais Luther et Hitler étaient tous les deux aussi coupables que Judas. Nous sommes tous coupables. Sur ce point, la Bible est très claire. Demandez-moi pourquoi Luther ne savait pas cela. Ma réponse est que Luther n’avait pas l’Esprit de Dieu. Eût-il eu l’Esprit, il n’aurait pas été capable d’attaquer et de vilipender les juifs ou n’importe qui d’autre. Bien qu’il sortît de l’église catholique, l’église catholique ne sortit pas entièrement de lui.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">D’autre part, qu’on le veuille ou non, que l’on en débatte ou non, les juifs sont le peuple élu et la nation de Dieu. Oui, Dieu les rejeta et se tourna vers les gentils, mais la Bible dit aussi très clairement que Dieu va sauver les juifs en fin de compte :</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">« Et ainsi tout Israël sera sauvé, comme il est écrit : ‘Le libérateur sortira de Sion, et Il détournera l’impiété de Jacob ; Car ceci est Mon alliance avec eux, quand J&#8217;ôterai leurs péchés’ » (Romains 11:26-27 Traduit de la version EMTV).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">De quelle autre nation le Messie est-Il venu ? D’où est venue la Bible, si ce n’est des juifs ? Quel autre livre se compare-t-il à la Bible ? Quelle autre nation a-t-elle été restaurée dans le monde après sa destruction et 2000 ans de dispersion à travers le monde, de retour sur son territoire d’origine, ne serait-ce qu’en partie&#8230;pour le moment ? C’est ce que la Bible appelle la « nouvelle naissance » ou être « né de nouveau ». Il est aussi écrit :</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">« Quant à l&#8217;évangile, ils sont ennemis à cause de vous ; mais quant à l&#8217;élection, ils sont aimés à cause de leurs pères. Car les dons et l&#8217;appel de Dieu sont irrévocables. Car, tout comme vous étiez autrefois désobéissants à Dieu, mais maintenant vous avez obtenu miséricorde par leur désobéissance, de même maintenant ceux-ci étaient désobéissants, afin que par la miséricorde qui vous a été faite, ils obtiennent aussi miséricorde. Car Dieu a enfermé tous [les hommes] dans la désobéissance, afin qu’Il fasse miséricorde à tous. Oh, la profondeur des richesses à la fois de la sagesse et de la connaissance de Dieu ! Comme ses jugements sont insondables et ses voies intraçables !  ‘Car qui a connu la pensée du SEIGNEUR ? Ou qui a été Son conseiller ?’ ‘Ou qui Lui a donné le premier, et cela lui sera rendu ?’ Car de Lui et par Lui et à Lui sont toutes choses ; à Lui soit la gloire pour toujours ! Amen » (Romains 11:28-36 Traduit de la version EMTV).</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">“Dieu les utilise comme instruments pour châtier Son peuple.”</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Parce que les juifs sont les élus de Dieu dans ce monde, Dieu exige plus d’eux. Parce qu’ils ont connu les choses de Dieu plus que toute autre nation, étant les porteurs de l’Alliance et de la Loi et du Messie, ils sont les plus responsables. « De celui à qui beaucoup est donné, beaucoup est exigé. » Les juifs ont pris et prendront le grand châtiment, mais je vous garantis solennellement et avec reconnaissance, par la Parole de Dieu, que lorsque le Seigneur aura fini de châtier Son peuple, alors qu’ils étaient les derniers, ils seront les premiers ; alors qu’ils étaient la queue, ils seront la tête ; alors qu’ils furent haïs, méprisés et détruits, ils seront aimés et honorés et sauvés, et leurs ennemis seront haïs, méprisés et détruits. Il a endurci les cœurs de ceux qui haïssent Israël afin de les détruire. Cela va arriver. Maintenant même, où est Saddam Hussein, par exemple ? Où est l’Irak ? Regardez ces choses se dérouler. Dieu les utilise comme instruments pour châtier Son peuple, ensuite Il jette ces instruments dans le feu.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Voici la promesse de Dieu pour Hitler (déjà accomplie) et pour tous les ennemis des juifs, y compris les musulmans : « Je bénirai ceux qui te béniront et je maudirai ceux qui te maudiront ».</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">J’attends constamment des juifs qu’ils soient meilleurs et qu’ils fassent mieux, mais tout ce qu’ils font, c’est copier le monde, adorer ses dieux, et vivre de toutes les manières dont le font les gentils. Honte aux juifs ! Honte à Israël ! Bien que tu ne sois pas pire que le reste, tu n’es pas meilleur, ce que tu devrais être, et par conséquent ton péché est plus grand. Ton péché étant plus grand, ta punition est plus grande. Pourtant, ton Dieu te délivrera avec tous les autres.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Je dois mentionner encore un autre grand péché de l’Occident. Il a hypocritement critiqué Israël, demandant qu’Israël fasse preuve de retenue pendant qu’il était impitoyablement matraqué à l’intérieur et à l’extérieur de ses frontières. Aucune nation ne souffre de la contradiction qui lui est imposée comme Israël. Maintenant comment l’Amérique répond-elle quand elle est attaquée ? Toute la puissance de feu sort au nom de la « justice ». Oui, comme c’est vertueux de l’Amérique, comme c’est vertueux !

Beaucoup ont vu et entendu les obscénités de la religion au Nom du Christ. Beaucoup ont protesté l’impiété de l’Amérique, et ces avertissements et réprimandes ont été ignorés. Et quand les prédicateurs qui sont très aimés par l’Amérique et l’Europe se lèvent pour parler, que prêchent-ils ? Ils prêchent la pitié et la paix. Billy Graham put seulement condamner Al-Qaïda et sa violence à New York. Prêcha-t-il contre la cause de cette tragédie ? Connaissait-il même la cause de cet événement ? A-t-il reconnu la main du châtiment de Dieu ? Les péchés de l’Amérique et son hypocrisie, son mode de vie décadent, son orgueil et son arrogance, sa richesse au détriment des autres en sont la cause. Pourquoi Billy Graham n’a-t-il pas appelé à la repentance, informant l&#8217;Amérique qu’à moins qu’elle ne se repente, il y aurait l’enfer à payer ? C’est parce que Billy Graham, Benny Hinn et des milliers d’autres prédicateurs sont tous dans la prostitution devant Dieu&#8230;tous. Il s’agit d’apparences, de se sentir bien, d’hommes pensant qu’ils « couvrent une multitude de péchés avec l’amour », tout en grattant les dos, en chatouillant les oreilles, en valorisant les louanges des hommes, en fermant les yeux sur les péchés des uns et des autres, adorant l’adoration au Nom de Dieu. « Chaque homme fait ce qui est juste à ses propres yeux ». C’est l’iniquité qui est rampante, mais avec une pose pieuse, un goût religieux, une sainte posture, une forme de piété </span><strong style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">qui donne à Dieu l’envie de vomir</strong><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">“Le temps est venu pour la punition car les avertissements ont été vains.”</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Lorsque nous disons ces choses aux gens, on </span><strong style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">nous</strong><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\"> connait comme étant ceux qui font vomir Dieu. </span><strong style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Nous</strong><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\"> sommes ceux qui sont haineux, arrogants, méchants, stupides, ridicules, faux, diviseurs, ignorants, hérétiques, fanatiques, légalistes, désobligeant, prétentieux, orgueilleux, et sans amour. Quelle audience endurcie, têtue, corrompue et implacable nous avons ! Beaucoup de nos détracteurs prétendent aimer l’humanité, avoir son meilleur intérêt à cœur, mais ils montrent leurs couleurs dans leur haine manifeste envers nous et Dieu quand nous les appelons à se repentir de leurs péchés et à se tourner vers Dieu. Aimants, nous sommes accusés de haine ; ceux à qui nous prêchons haïssent, pourtant prétendent aimer. Ils appellent le bien le mal, et le mal le bien.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Pourquoi doit-on rappeler aux soi-disant croyants en Dieu que les images sont interdites ? Pourquoi doit-on leur rappeler que la débauche sexuelle, l’ivresse, et une vie insouciante sont des péchés ?

Ils le font maintenant et se sont à peine présentés, certains avec des armes à feu, et certains avec des roses, construisant leurs plateformes de liberté d’expression dans nos pays, leurs mosquées à partir desquelles ils vont s’infiltrer, inculquer, endoctriner, et inciter contre le pays d’accueil, lui prenant les libertés non accordées aux occidentaux ou voire à eux-mêmes dans les pays musulmans. Les musulmans sont ici, envoyés par Dieu, dans le but précis de juger l’Amérique et l’Occident. Tout comme les musulmans sont parfaitement hypocrites et contradictoires, ainsi l’Occident l’a été avec Dieu.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">L’Occident a grandement besoin des musulmans. Je me souviens que mes parents me disaient quand j’étais indiscipliné, « Tu demandes la fessée ! » L’Occident a imploré l’épée et la destruction, et commence maintenant à recevoir ce qu’il a demandé avec insistance. Il est temps pour la punition car les avertissements ont été vains et méprisés. Ça ne sera pas long. Le processus a commencé et s’intensifiera sans relâche, jusqu’à ce que beaucoup soient emportés.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Où est la liberté d’expression ?

Yet, you speak so confidently as though you are so right?\r\nSee, you blaspheme against God, you’re contrary to the Scriptures along with a Prince of Blasphemers, and to those who are the elect.

Le prédicateur s’est étudié à trouver des paroles agréables; et ce qui a été écrit est droit, des paroles de vérité. Les paroles des sages sont comme des aiguillons, et les recueils, comme des clous enfoncés: ils sont donnés par un seul Berger. » (Ecclésiaste 12, 9-11.)\r\nAu milieu de la nuit du 15 au 16 avril 2007, des proverbes m’ont été donnés. Comme un robinet ouvert, ils vinrent, l’un après l’autre, 78 au total. Alors, aussi vite qu’ils étaient venus, ils cessèrent, comme un robinet que l’on ferme. Il n’y eut aucune préméditation, aucune attente et lorsque la fin arriva, il n’y eut rien que je puisse faire pour continuer. Ils étaient là, tout simplement.\r\n\r\nDepuis lors le Seigneur m’en a donné davantage, lorsque je suis silencieux, à Sa façon, et quand Il le veut.\r\n\r\nLes principes de la vie ont de nombreuses manifestations, chacune d’entre elles pouvant être exprimée comme un proverbe. Un proverbe peut apparaître simple en surface, exprimant une évidence, au point même de donner l’impression que c’est un simplet qui parle. Cependant, à mesure qu’une personne contemple les mots et recherche une signification plus profonde, il ou elle sera récompensé (e) d’un conseil et d’un discernement qui sert bien dans de nombreuses applications de la vie, si Dieu choisit de les lui impartir.\r\n\r\nVictor Hafichuk...</div></div></a></div><!-- close relpost-block-container --><div style=\"clear: both\"></div></div><!-- close filter class --></div><!-- close relpost-thumb-wrapper -->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From: Genevieve To: The Path of Truth Sent: Sunday, April 17, 2016 5:38 AM  Read your comments regarding John Ramirez.

I have looked into this area  of the courts and believe me, there are a LOT of cases! It seems to be the silver bullet for women to frame men or for men/women to get back at another individual (usually a male) by using a child or a teen to lie and so on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">motive? money, anger, vengeance, mischief and teens wanting to run away  so accuse their parents. There are fraudulent therapies still being used  called &#8220;false memory&#8221; which is used to convince  women they were abused. Our Judge over- saw another case in which a woman discovered &#8220;she was abused&#8221; after having &#8220;therapy&#8221; , many years after the alleged fact. The therapy  stemmed  from a book called &#8220;Courage to Heal&#8221; , debunked in the 90&#8217;s </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Not much different than the  &#8220;false Teaching&#8221;  you are exposing &#8211; same mindset. It is misleading and dangerous. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">I am afraid the courts favour &#8220;personality&#8221; over truth (ie: unbelievers, friends, family who all got on the band wagon once allegations came against him.) </span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">It was essentially a witch hunt &#8211; </span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Sadly, these cases help &#8220;set a precedent&#8221;  for more woman to accuse </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Attached is a paper on wrongfully Convicted in Canada </span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Here is a movie which is quite good, based on a true story.

Some cases of innocence may be convincing, but AIDWYC may not be able to find fresh evidence supporting innocence despite its best efforts. In this type of situation, AIDWYC has no choice but to close the case because new and significant evidence is required to make it possible to advance the case to legal proceedings. Although AIDWYC does its best to assist as many people as possible, only a small minority of our total applications advance to the stage of legal proceedings and, eventually, exoneration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">How is my husband reacting? His main focus is Jesus and he has advised me to cooperate with his purposes and forgive  our enemies. That doesn&#8217;t mean it was easy for these last 7 years! We went through a  the whole gambit of emotions. (as in the Psalms!) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">But my husband is reaching out to others, sharing his faith in Jesus, his knowledge of the Bible (which God usually uses him for) He is a great encourager so GOD can use him in the poison but it is severe and not fair to our family but &#8230; we can&#8217;t do a lot about it but trust GOD </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Pray we are able to trust the Lord through this &#8211; of course I want all this to unfold adn be exposed for what it is . Exposure reveals who is lying, who is telling the truth adn this needs to happen. We can&#8217;t appeal again uncles we get fresh evidence  but better, that the main false accuser repents and comes to the Lord!! But the courts even then, will do nothing because recantations are viewed a s on being scared the accused will come after them later. A lot of darkness in cases like this. The light we offered was stomped on but they are dealing with the Lord GOD Almighty so&#8230; we&#8217;ll see ! 🙂 </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">This is why we are praying.

And for sharing your website. To answer your latest question, we don’t have any specific writings on how one should respond to false allegations in court. And truly, there is no single answer. One person will be given to say things by the Lord; another will speak by saying nothing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">A brother in the Lord with whom we’re associated had two appearances in court this past year in a divorce case initiated by his wife, who falsely accused him of neglect due to “being in a cult.” The first appearance he had nothing to say to the judge, whereas the second time he was given things to say. There is no formula – there is only faith in Christ and His will.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Consider how the Lord Himself held His peace as He stood accused before Pilate:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">John 19:7-11 MKJV</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">(7)  The Jews answered him, We have a Law, and by our Law he ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">(8)  Then when Pilate heard that saying, he was the more afraid.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">(9)  And he went again into the praetorium and said to Jesus, Where are You from? But Jesus gave him no answer.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">(10)  Then Pilate said to Him, Do You not speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to crucify You, and I have authority to release You?</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">(11)  Jesus answered, You could have no authority against Me unless it were given to you from above. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Are you and your husband aware the Lord is in full control, always has been and always will be? Your husband, even if innocent of the act he was convicted of, is in prison not by accident but by the perfect will of God Who creates both good and evil:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Isaiah 45:5-7 MKJV</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">(5)  I am the LORD, and there is none else, no God besides Me; I clothed you, though you have not known Me;</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">(6)  that they may know from the rising of the sun, and to the sunset, that there is none besides Me.

I the LORD do all these things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Your husband is in prison by the sovereign will of God, whatever His purpose may be and which will be revealed in due time.

It was a common practice.  Gods people congregating went through many stages despite having tares amongst wheat where God had this remain until the harvest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">The reason the Lord has allowed many denominations was to scatter the body of Christ  in order to protect them so they were not in one location, more vulnerable for attack being noticed.   God must have read the Art of War. Actually, he IS the Art of War!  The various denominations were no mistake. Each one  concentrated on one various parts of Gods truth that is, bringing back  truths around believers baptism , another the anointing of the Holy Spirit, another the food laws, another the Nazarite Law (not  obligatory  but never-the-less, a common practice which Jesus himself would have participated in)  so there is a reason for   the structures to have been invented as you say. It was like a puzzle in which enemies of Yeshuah would not be able to decipher. Much like drawing 1/2 the sign of the fish upon meeting a person to see if he/she knew how to draw the rest, revealing they too were Christians. My daughter said to me, she &#8220;can tell&#8221; when she meets a Christian. I said to her that is the Holy Spirit teaching you to discern.   It is GOD who is in control and he has strategy. He even had strategy with emperor CONSTANTINE St. Francis  Augustine and so on &#8211; despite the archaic practices which in time had to be corrected. People were in the dark but the dark  never over comes the light &#8211;  and GOD distributes his light as he pleases, lifting the veil of deception so we know more and more as we come closer to the end of age. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">&#8220;Babylon&#8221; is not the scattering denominations where GOD has often told his people to stay for his purposes, or leave for his purposes &#8211; it is the VATICAN  and the  One world Order, the Antichrist(s) and obviously these beliefs, doctrines, mind-sets etc.  trickle down to other denominations such as the Anglican Church, Baptists too (some so-called Baptist Evangelists are probably in cahoots with the Catholics. Hitler was!) </span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">So what I am saying is GOD calls us out of many situations and back into them for HIS purposes. The church structure that is tainted is no different that the &#8220;world&#8221; we are to come out of so we don&#8217;t have to concentrate on abandoning this any more than abandoning the world &#8211; we have to abide in the vine, stay with Yeshuah, though I agree we must separate of course. GODS people, many of which are remaining  in structures are also there (some) for GODS purposes to reach others, as tough as that is. God knows his own and where they MUST be placed &#8211; Some remain to ward off false teachers   or provide a haven for homeless, to feed people.  (I don&#8217;t see Christian taking the homeless into their homes) This is why EVERYTHING is in Gods hands. ALL these structures are merely Gods tools and if he wants them there- they WILL remain  for HIS use.  ( A good friend used to say, he uses them to keep people busy so they are not messing up the higher purposes of those closer to him!) Many naive people seek only the Church structure to come to GOD when they don&#8217;t really have to but because God loves them, he will place his people in strategic places all over &#8211; despite the wolves in the structured church as it were &#8211; there will ALWAYS be wolves  so we can not really &#8220;come out&#8221; completely from these wolves  &#8211; we have to be stewards of where GOD puts us even if it happens to be in a structured place. Obedience is better than sacrifice </span></p>\n<p><em style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Adonai</em><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\"> your God will expel those nations ahead of you little by little; you can’t put an end to them all at once, or the wild animals will become too numerous for you. </span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\"> </span><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Deuteronomy%207%3A22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Deuteronomy%207%3A22</a></p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">From:</strong><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\"> Victor and Paul</span><br />\n<strong style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">To:</strong><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\"> Dorothea</span><br />\n<strong style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Sent:</strong><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\"> Monday, February 22, 2016 7:26 AM</span><br />\n<strong style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Subject:</strong><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\"> Writings for Scott</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; ;background: transparent;\">Dorothea, we think it would be best for you to search our site and see what writings you feel might be of value to Scott and you can take it from there.

Why is each conference more than $130 dollars, \r\nfor 4 meetings ?    They have bought 3 huge multi million buildings just recently.\r\n\r\nI have never met the pastor.   He is a celebrity.   He never comes to the lobby.  \r\n\r\nHe rushes in to the sanctuary before he preaches and he practically runs out.   \r\n\r\nHe only 'prays' for his junior pastors.

The Kingdom of God doesn’t come by observation (tactile senses). \r\n\r\n“And when He was demanded of the Pharisees, when the Kingdom of God should come, He answered them and said, The Kingdom of God comes not with observation: Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the Kingdom of God is within you” (Luke 17:20-21 KJV).\r\n\r\nYes, the Kingdom is on a different plane altogether from the physical or psychical.  \r\n\r\nAnd no, because God doesn’t torture people endlessly doesn’t make Catholic purgatory true. You need to go to the Lord for the pure truth, and by the Fire of Truth, He will purge you of all unholy mixture and unrighteousness.

He hosts a podcast on SoundCloud, where he addresses a variety of topics related to life as a Christian, presenting himself as one with a strong theological foundation.</p>\n<p>Our interest was piqued when we listened to his recent episode, “Ep. 175 &#8211; A Biblical Case for Christmas”. This article takes a look at his recent Christmas podcasts (<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/christisthecure/ep-148-christmas-and-paganism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">#148</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/christisthecure/ep-149-christ-and-christmas-continued\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">#149</a>, and <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/christisthecure/ep-175-a-biblical-case-for-celebrating-christmas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">#175</a>), and addresses his error.</p>\n<p>The only reason I can think of why Nick warrants any attention to his discussion of Christmas is that he approaches it from an unusual, though nonsensical, position, which offers us another opportunity to denounce by Truth, an ungodly discussion in the Name of the things of God. Otherwise, his opinion isn’t worth anything. However, perhaps the reader will find that our response to Nick holds partial value if only to make them consider their current position.</p>\n<h3>“Strong Historical Case”</h3>\n<p>Despite what a wide breadth of historians say (secular or otherwise), Nick Campbell believes to the contrary, that there is historical evidence that demonstrates the roots of Christmas are not pagan in origin:</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“So here I try to look at all the data together, contrary to what we often see, which is usually arguments focused on individual points of interest, and I want to connect it </span><em style=\"color: #980000;\"><u>all</u></em><span style=\"color: #980000;\">.” (#148 &#8211; 8:10)</span></p>\n<p>His focus on Christmas is not whether it was originally pagan or was made to replace a pagan holiday. All that matters to him is the holiday’s original intended focus.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“Is Christmas pagan? Now what many are actually asking, whenever they ask this question, is are the roots of Christmas pagan? And if we answer this question, we are left with the answer </span><strong style=\"color: #980000;\">no</strong><span style=\"color: #980000;\">, because of the specifical qualification of Christmas’s definition and </span><strong style=\"color: #980000;\"><u>original focus</u></strong><span style=\"color: #980000;\">, despite any relations that may have occurred between pagan holidays, or even assimilation of objects or traditions.” (#175 &#8211; 10:41)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“So this is something we need to stress </span><strong style=\"color: #980000;\"><em><u>even if</u></em></strong><span style=\"color: #980000;\"> Christmas turns out to replace or Christianize a pagan holiday. Its purpose, function, and role are </span><em style=\"color: #980000;\">categorically</em> <strong style=\"color: #980000;\"><em><u>not pagan</u></em></strong><span style=\"color: #980000;\"> and categorically Christian. Regardless of how we feel about Christianization. We </span><strong style=\"color: #980000;\"><em><u>cannot</u></em></strong><span style=\"color: #980000;\"> stress this enough. </span><strong style=\"color: #980000;\"><em><u>By definition</u></em></strong><span style=\"color: #980000;\">, by its purpose and function &#8211; it is </span><strong style=\"color: #980000;\"><em><u>not pagan</u></em></strong><span style=\"color: #980000;\">. Even if it was to replace something else that was. ” (#148 &#8211; 11:00)</span></p>\n<p>This is already a slippery slope! If the holiday was originally pagan and it was “Christianized”, then the actions of early adherents were in direct rebellion to God’s commandments to <strong>destroy</strong>, not save or adopt:</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">“Tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars, burn up their Asherah poles, </span><strong style=\"color: #121212;\"><em><u>cut down the idols of their gods, and wipe out their names from every place</u></em></strong><span style=\"color: #121212;\">. </span><u style=\"color: #121212;\">You shall not worship the LORD your God in this way</u><span style=\"color: #121212;\">…” (Deuteronomy 12:30-31 BSB)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">“You shall not walk in the customs of the nation, which I am casting out before you: for they did all these things, </span><strong style=\"color: #121212;\"><em><u>and therefore I abhorred them</u></em></strong><span style=\"color: #121212;\">.” (Leviticus 20:22 WEB)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Not only does Nick Campbell want us to take the risk of doing that which the Lord patently abhors, he is arrogant enough to say we shouldn’t feel condemnation if we later discover that we had disobeyed God? Despite this risk, Nick is going to continue, dragging us with him down the serpent’s den as he pursues his search for both a “historical” holiday with clean intent and no pagan heritage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Nick lays out what he calls “</span><span style=\"color: #980000;\">theological presuppositions</span><span style=\"color: #121212;\">” as a backdrop to his “</span><span style=\"color: #980000;\">rock-solid</span>”<span style=\"color: #121212;\"> evidence. Each of these assumptions are based upon his idea that historical evidence invariably comes from secularists, who have a desire to crush Christianity at every opportunity </span><span style=\"color: #980000;\">(#148 &#8211; 12:59)</span><span style=\"color: #121212;\">. So he believes evidence from them should always be held in high skepticism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">And yet, Nick doesn’t apply the same reasoning to celebration of Christmas itself. If the celebration is truly Christian, why is it that all the “secularists” in the world absolutely love it? Was the Lord wrong when He said “&#8230;what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God” (Luke 16:15 NKJV)?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Despite the contradiction, Nick wants us to keep in mind his idea that the world hates Christianity as he presents us with the historical “evidence” he has found. We will break down each point and show why each is not worth considering.</span></p>\n<h4>Tertullian</h4>\n<p>Nick Campbell states that Tertullian (155 &#8211; 220 AD) spoke against several pagan festivals, including Saturnalia, and that believers should not be decorating their house like a Roman brothel. It is important to note that it is not clear whether Tertullian was saying to stop entirely or to decorate differently than the pagans.</p>\n<p>Here is an immediate red flag. Both <a href=\"https://rsc.byu.edu/celebrating-easter/christian-history-development-easter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tertullian and Justin Martyr</a> considered Sunday the day of the Resurrection and were advocating that believers should celebrate on that day. Tertullian also believed that the Lord’s Advent (Second Coming) was far off in the future, not something to be had presently. Neither one of them was a man of God, being devoid of His Spirit. See <a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/teachings/three-days-and-three-nights.htm\">Three Days and Three Nights</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/falsehood-exposed/diabolical-doctrines/the-second-coming.htm\">The Second Coming</a>.</p>\n<h4>Clement of Alexandria</h4>\n<p>Postulated <a href=\"https://pursiful.com/2006/12/19/when-was-jesus-born-clement-of-alexandria/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">possible birth dates</a> for Jesus Christ. He wanted to know because of the celebration of the Passion. One for November 18th when using the Roman Calendar, and one for January 6th when using the Egyptian one. Nick Campbell believes that because some traditions have held 12 days of festivities (Christmastide), starting on December 25th and ending on January 6th (Epiphany), there must have been a connection to Clement’s January 6th birthday calculation. The sum of this is just speculation based on loose association. That doesn’t make it strong evidence.</p>\n<h4>Hippolytus of Rome</h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0b5394;\">“For the first advent of our Lord in the flesh, when he was born in Bethlehem, eight days before the calends of January [December 25th], the 4th day of the week [Wednesday], while Augustus was in his forty-second year, [2 or 3BC] but from Adam five thousand and five hundred years.” (Commentary on Daniel &#8211; 4:23:3)</span></p>\n<p>As his key witness, Nick Campbell quotes Hippolytus (<span style=\"color: #121212;\">202-211 AD)</span>, even though the text is seen largely as unreliable. Nick claims that it has been “dealt with” <a href=\"https://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/2010/01/12/the-text-tradition-of-hippolytus-commentary-on-daniel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>. But the earliest manuscripts containing pieces of it are from the 12-13th century. Even if the Greek text existed in the 10th century, there is no way to know for certain that it had been recorded accurately. At that time, Christmas was already long declared to occur on the 25th. A well-meaning copyist could have easily “corrected” the record then. See <a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/teachings/book-of-matthew-corrupted.htm\">The Book of Matthew Corrupted</a>.</p>\n<p>Even if we could assume Hippolytus’s writing to be authentic, Hippolytus condemned Modalism as heresy. He believed God to be three separate Persons, not One Person manifesting Himself in more than one role. In doing so, Hippolytus was denying the Son, not recognizing that He was the Father in the flesh. If he had truly known the Lord Jesus Christ, he would have never spoken that way. Read <a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/falsehood-exposed/trinity/asininity-of-the-trinity.htm\">The Asininity of the Trinity</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/teachings/jesusisgod/jesuschristalmightygod.htm\">Jesus Christ, Almighty God</a>.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, Nick believes that Hippolytus couldn’t have placed the date of Christmas on a pagan god’s birthday because <span style=\"color: #980000;\">“Christians came up with the birth of Jesus by math!” (#148 &#8211; 40:26)</span>.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: black;\">This was nothing more than a man coming up with a theory based on myth! At the time, people were already celebrating Easter, believing that Christ had died on March 25th. There was an old Jewish superstition that a prophet would die on the same day as his conception. It was also believed that Christ was conceived the same day the Earth was created, on March 25th. Hippolytus accepted these silly reasonings and added nine months since Christ’s assumed conception, for a birth date of December 25th.</span><br />\nNicomedia</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">The “20,000 Martyrs of Nicomedia” allegedly took place while they were in celebration of the nativity in 302 A.D., where the church was set ablaze and almost every adherent died. Sounds more like a case of God’s Wrath, seeing that He only allowed a handful to be saved, and even those were hunted down and executed. This is assuming the account can even be believed as reported, as is often the case with Catholic tradition. For instance, we know the number 20,000 was likely apocryphal.</span></p>\n<h4>Donatists</h4>\n<p>There is a claim that sometime before 312 A.D., it is the Donatists who had accepted and celebrated a December 25th birthdate. But it wasn’t known until around 400 A.D. when Augustine confirms that a group of Donatists did so. Nick Campbell thinks it is highly unlikely a sect that was extremely legalistic would ever knowingly adopt a pagan practice. Yet the highly self-righteous Donatists were later condemned as heretics! Why does Nick think these people serve as good witnesses to make an argument for clean worship? Also, <a href=\"https://www.gotquestions.org/donatism.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">his source</a> is from <a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/false-teachers/s.michael-houdmann.htm\">an author</a> who is himself, a false teacher.</p>\n<p>Nick appears to be more of a “<strong>di</strong>vestigator” than <strong>in</strong>vestigator or researcher. He isn’t too fussy about his sources or the quality of their offerings – not a wise thing when dealing with the things of God.</p>\n<h4>Sol Invictus &amp; the Chronography</h4>\n<p>Nick Campbell is adamant that Christmas could not have shared roots with Sol Invictus because of two crucial “hinge dates”, 274 and 354 AD.</p>\n<p>In 274 the Roman emperor Aurelian elevated and decreed the celebration of a cult sun god, Sol Invictus (Unconquerable Sun), and his birthday. He built a new temple in the center of Rome and dedicated it in his honor. It isn’t clear whether it was dedicated on December 25th, but it would follow, given that it was typical for Romans to dedicate items of worship on the special days of their gods.</p>\n<p>Because there is no clear record of Aurelian setting the 25th as the day for Sol Invictus, Nick states it must not have happened. He has a theory that the Romans <strong><em><u>must</u></em></strong> have co-opted the 25th day to steal it away from those celebrating the nativity according to the “testimony” of Hippolytus, Clement, and Tertullian. But as outlined previously, the evidence of such a likely or widespread celebration is scant, having been based upon assumption, myth, heretical leaders, “tradition”, and questionable records.</p>\n<p>Eighty years later, the <a href=\"https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/chronography_of_354_06_calendar.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chronography of 354 AD</a> was made for a Roman aristocrat by a calligrapher, both reported to be “Christian”. On the calendar itself, it is marked on December 25th, <span style=\"color: #0b5394;\">“N·INVICTI·CM·XXX”</span><span style=\"color: #121212;\">, </span>which means “Birthday • Unconquered • Games Ordered • 30”. <u>There is no other celebration listed on that day</u>. <strong><em><u>Elsewhere</u></em></strong> there is a note stating “Jesus Christ was born 8 days before January” in 1 AD.</p>\n<p>One, Nick is hyper-focused on the exclusion of “Sol” from “Unconquered” stating that the holiday <span style=\"color: #980000;\">“could or could not be for Sol Invictus” (#148 &#8211; 36:55)</span>, alluding that it is for another holiday like a feast of nativity celebrating Christ. However, “Sol Invictus” was a particularly unique sun god and “Invictus” was a common enough epithet at the time. In the same way, one today may refer to the “Steelers”, everyone understands you are talking about the Pittsburg Steelers football team.</p>\n<p>Two, he is missing an obvious contradiction. If a “Christian” calligrapher constructed this for a “Christian” aristocrat, then why is something like a “Feast of the Nativity” not also listed on the calendar itself on December 25th with or without “Invictus”? If it was such a special holy day and as widely recognized as Nick would like to believe, then <strong><em><u>surely</u></em></strong> these “Christians” would have included it on their own calendar!</p>\n<p>Despite the contradiction, Nick Campbell is so sure of himself and proudly moves on<span style=\"color: #980000;\"> “&#8230; and we have a date that is earlier than the initiation date of Sol Invictus. Bunked. Debunked!” (#148 &#8211; 38:43)</span></p>\n<h4>Apostolic Constitutions</h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Nick </span>Campbell<span style=\"color: #121212;\"> quotes the Apostolic Constitutions (375 to 380 AD), </span><span style=\"color: #0b5394;\">“Brethren, observe the festival days; and first of all the birthday which you are to celebrate on the twenty-fifth of the ninth month; after which let the Epiphany be to you the most honoured” (Book V, Section 3)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">The writers and/or combiner of these documents is unknown. Even at the earliest date, they would have been written </span><strong style=\"color: #121212;\"><em><u>100 years after</u></em></strong><span style=\"color: #121212;\"> the proclamation of Sol Invictus in 274 AD and </span><strong style=\"color: #121212;\"><em><u>20 years after</u></em></strong><span style=\"color: #121212;\"> Chronography of 354 AD. Which doesn’t make it proof of a celebration occurring before Nick’s “hinge dates”.</span></p>\n<h4>John Chrysostom of Antioch</h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Nick Campbell states that in 386 AD., John Chrysostom </span><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“notes that the celebration celebrating the birth of Christ is an ancient tradition” (#148 &#8211; 24:10)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Nick calls it an “ancient tradition!”. However, in his own </span><a href=\"https://earlychurchtexts.com/public/john_chrysostom_homily_in_diem_natalem_domini_nostri_jesu_christi.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">homily</a><span style=\"color: #121212;\">, John Chrysostom notes that it has barely been 10 years now, that the celebration has existed, </span><strong style=\"color: #121212;\"><em><u>brought in from the West</u></em></strong><span style=\"color: #121212;\">. </span><em style=\"color: #121212;\">(Note that Rome is west of Antioch)</em><span style=\"color: #121212;\">. He states </span><span style=\"color: #0b5394;\">“I well know that many are still debating with each other about it, some </span><strong style=\"color: #0b5394;\"><em><u>arguing against</u></em></strong><span style=\"color: #0b5394;\">, some for. Everywhere there is a lot of conversation about this day, some saying </span><strong style=\"color: #0b5394;\"><em><u>accusingly that the day is a new innovation which has only recently been introduced…</u></em></strong><span style=\"color: #0b5394;\">”</span><span style=\"color: #121212;\">. He also tells everyone who celebrates: </span><span style=\"color: #0b5394;\">“Expect a repayment worthy of such zeal from Christ who is born today in the flesh. He will reward you for this enthusiasm.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Who is John to declare that God is now obligated to reward people because of something men do? Wasn’t this the lesson Job had to learn? Loose speaking like this by John Chrysostom also helped promote antisemitism through his sermons which the Nazis used in their persecution of Jews!</span></p>\n<h4>Spurgeon and Calvin</h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“So how should we conclude this? And I thought maybe by discussing the sentiments of some of those who came before us” (#175 &#8211; 40:43)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“But regardless, Spurgeon also loved Christmas … Spurgeon has further noted as participating in the festivities of Christmas, even dressing as Santa Claus, who delivers gifts to orphans.” (#175 &#8211; 41:14)</span></p>\n<p>So we are supposed to take this as “evidence” of a biblically clean holiday. Spurgeon, hailed as the “prince of preachers” was a corrupt man, a blathering religious fool. He <a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/blog-wars/making-sport-holy-things.htm#spurgeon\">mocked the things of God</a> and praised Calvin, a rabid murderer of Christians such as Servetus. But take Nick’s word for it, Spurgeon dressing up as Santa Claus makes all the difference and makes it okay to celebrate Christmas.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“Calvin, in particular, is often painted as one who was just detesting Christmas. But he actually, quote, sought to reclaim Christmas as a celebration of Christian activity …” (#175 &#8211; 42:38)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“Some of Calvin&#8217;s most moving words from the pulpit flowed from his preaching on Christmas.” (#175 &#8211; 43:30)</span></p>\n<p>Was he going to do it in the same way he reclaimed his status among men after <strong><em><u>murdering those who disagreed with him</u></em></strong>? Calvin and his evil religious fanatics murdered Michael Servetus, deliberately roasting him over a slow-burning fire for disagreeing with him. And when Michael was dead, Calvin in his book spat on Servetus, calling him a “detestable infidel”, “obscene dog”, “vomit” and “rabid magician.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0b5394;\">“Honor, glory, and riches shall be the reward of your pains; but above all, do not fail to rid the country of those scoundrels, who stir up the people to revolt against us. Such monsters should be exterminated, </span><strong style=\"color: #0b5394;\">as I have exterminated Michael Servetus</strong><span style=\"color: #0b5394;\"> the Spaniard.”</span><em style=\"color: #0b5394;\"> &#8211; Letter to the Marquis Paet</em></p>\n<p>And now Nick wants us to believe a <strong><em><u>murderer</u></em></strong> is a good witness for celebrating Christmas. Wow!</p>\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/false-teachers/john-calvin.htm\">The Fruit of Cain Multiplied: The Murderer John Calvin</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“And despite the previous discussions on topic, I&#8217;m not entirely convinced of December 25 as being a realistic or true date of the Nativity, but rather a traditional placeholder.” (#175 &#8211; 41:38)</span></p>\n<p>Then what <strong><em><u>was the entire point</u></em></strong> of trying so hard to defend December 25th? The paper-thin wall between Nick and total blasphemy <strong><em><u>entirely depends</u></em></strong> on Nick getting the day right!</p>\n<h4>Closing History</h4>\n<p>Nick Campbell’s strongest “evidence” is entirely dependent on there being a widespread, ancient celebration of the nativity “testified” early on by Hippolytus and his number crunching, prior to 274 AD and before 354 AD. He has only scraps of “evidence”, nothing concrete or trustworthy to support this mystery holiday. All his points are actually arguing <strong><em><u>against him</u></em></strong>. And get this, at the end of his presentation, he admits it was only <strong><em><u>HIS</u></em></strong> <strong>opinion</strong>!</p>\n<p>Lord Jesus, why do we even bother to address this confounded fellow!? Surely, there are more valuable things to do! Will anyone be edified by this, and how?</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“When Christmas was being formed as a feast to celebrate, was it pagan? The answer is no. </span><strong style=\"color: #980000;\"><em><u>In my opinion</u></em></strong><span style=\"color: #980000;\">, no. The day was discussed prior, the feast was had prior, um, there’s more evidence of secularists stomping on it just like they do today.” (#148 &#8211; 49:50)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“Or you will see the blanket statement. The Roman Church created Christmas because they wanted to Christianize everything. And what you find is that all of these claims are ahistorical. Our generation is so </span><strong style=\"color: #980000;\">ignorant</strong><span style=\"color: #980000;\"> on history, and you know, </span><strong style=\"color: #980000;\"><em><u>I am not an expert in church history</u></em></strong><span style=\"color: #980000;\"> by any stretch of the imagination.” (#149 &#8211; 18:20)</span></p>\n<p>Nick is only giving us his own opinions, which is speaking according to the flesh. His theory is that Christmas can’t be pagan if the celebrations that historians believe Christmas took over (Saturnalia, Sol Invictus, etc.) were occurring at the same time. Even if there was iron-clad evidence to demonstrate a separate ‘Feast of Nativity’ as Nick claims, it doesn’t mean adherents were right under God to start it and celebrate the incarnation of Christ, which we address in the next section.</p>\n<p>While history may be unclear as to what transpired, it is certainly evident that in later centuries, the embodiment of pagan worship <strong><em><u>certainly did</u></em></strong> work its way into the church, in tradition, sacrament, ritual, decoration, doctrine, and practice. Reading Alexander Hislop’s <a href=\"https://www.biblebelievers.com/babylon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Two Babylons</a> will help you see some of the connections. The false church, (little “c”), the Whore of Babylon is filled to the brim with every wicked thing and a tongue of blasphemy. Nick Campbell holds this truth in utter disdain:</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“So the implications again of saying this is pagan is &#8211; the ramifications are huge compared to what people realize … I don’t understand &#8211; you don’t understand those ramifications that the early church right at the offset was adopting paganism. I mean </span><strong style=\"color: #980000;\"><em><u>come on!</u></em></strong><span style=\"color: #980000;\"> Like, I don’t understand why you’d be okay with that?” (#149 &#8211; 38:16)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Yet this was precisely what Paul warned would happen after he died. For three years he warned the true Church night and day with tears to stay vigilant knowing what was coming:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Acts 20:29-31 KJV</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #121212;\">(29) For I know this: that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #121212;\">(30) Also from among your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #121212;\">(31) Therefore watch and remember that for the space of three years I ceased not to warn everyone night and day with tears.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">In the Book of Revelation, John wrote to churches under his care where six out of seven had already fallen in deception, only a few years after the Lord’s Crucifixion and Resurrection. Can you imagine how much worse it could get given 2000 years? We don’t have to, because we can see the fruits of such falsehood here, today, in the false church.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Nick doesn’t understand, because </span><strong style=\"color: #121212;\"><em><u>HE</u></em></strong><span style=\"color: #121212;\"> is part of the Harlot system. He partakes in their fleshly ways and continues the same sin of his “church fathers” centuries earlier:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“We celebrate the actual Unconquerable [Son/Sun?]’s entrance into the world. We celebrate the True Light’s entrance into this dark world. So a part of me thinks, Providence, really. Just as God showed up the Egyptians with the Plagues at the Exodus, part of me wonders if this is the same.” (#148 &#8211; 1:00:30)</span></p>\n<h3>“Solid Biblical Case”</h3>\n<p>After outlining his “historical” case in Episode <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/christisthecure/ep-148-christmas-and-paganism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">#148</a>, Campbell was taken to task by a few people in the comment section. He addressed them in the next episode (<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/christisthecure/ep-149-christ-and-christmas-continued\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">#149</a>), which Nick admits he didn’t have much preparation time and was less polished. We appreciate it because it offered us a peek into the true Nick Campbell, where one can observe in full Nick’s arrogance, brazen reasoning, blatant dismissal, and carnal reasoning.</p>\n<p>Nick admitted in this episode that he used to think Christmas was pagan and told his wife for a while, he wasn’t comfortable celebrating it. After discovering his historical and biblical “evidence”, he started to change his mind. This begs us to ask, what is it that compelled Nick Campbell to start spending countless hours searching for reasons to celebrate Christmas in the first place? Didn’t deceived Eve also persuade her husband Adam to “celebrate Christmas?”</p>\n<p>Shortly before Christmas, he then released Episode <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/christisthecure/ep-175-a-biblical-case-for-celebrating-christmas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">#175</a>, where he now outlines what he believes is a <span style=\"color: #980000;\">“strong biblical case” (#175 &#8211; 10:00)</span> for Christmas. He starts off falsely claiming that his previous episodes <span style=\"color: #980000;\">“dealt with the history of Christmas, which is a post-New Testament tradition.” (#175 &#8211; 3:15)</span>, and that the purpose of this podcast is to <span style=\"color: #980000;\">“demonstrate biblical support for celebrating the incarnation of God without having the explicit command to do so.” (#175 &#8211; 3:20)</span>.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“I simply ask you that if you&#8217;re listening to this, you should </span><u style=\"color: #980000;\">begin with a clean slate regarding your presuppositions on the pagan origins or </u><strong style=\"color: #980000;\"><u>just presuppose that I was correct in my assessment that Christmas isn&#8217;t pagan</u></strong><span style=\"color: #980000;\">&#8230;” (#175 &#8211; 4:10)</span></p>\n<p>“Don’t bother with Truth or confirmation. Take my word for it! Who needs two or three witnesses to establish anything?” suggests Nick. In other famous words, “Yea, has God said…?” Once again, Nick Campbell encourages us to ignore for a moment the idea that Christmas may be pagan in origin while he proceeds to regale us with his “Biblical” proof. Let’s take the time to knock down each of his “theological” pillars one by one.</p>\n<h4>Jesus was condemning legalism</h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“What becomes quite extraordinary is that these individuals who are loosely quoting Mark 7:8 to condemn the practice of Christmas are using a verse that was directed towards the legalism of the Pharisees, who added rules and regulations to Scripture.” (#175 &#8211; 7:40)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Nick </span>Campbell <span style=\"color: #121212;\">quotes Jesus’s condemnation of the Pharisee’s selfishness as if their error provides justification to continue the pagan traditions set forth by man, such as Christmas. Remarkably, it proves the very opposite. Jesus is warning people </span><strong style=\"color: #121212;\"><em>such as Nick</em></strong> <strong style=\"color: #121212;\"><u>against</u></strong><span style=\"color: #121212;\"> substitution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Mark 7:7-13 BSB</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #121212;\">(7) They worship Me in vain; they teach as doctrine the precepts of men.’</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #121212;\">(8) You have </span><em style=\"color: #121212;\"><u>disregarded the commandment of God </u></em><strong style=\"color: #121212;\"><em><u>to keep the tradition of men</u></em></strong><em style=\"color: #121212;\"><u>.</u></em><span style=\"color: #121212;\">”</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #121212;\">(9) He went on to say, “You neatly </span><em style=\"color: #121212;\"><u>set aside the command of God </u></em><strong style=\"color: #121212;\"><em><u>to maintain your own tradition</u></em></strong><span style=\"color: #121212;\">.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #121212;\">(10) For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother’ and ‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.’</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #121212;\">(11) </span><strong style=\"color: #121212;\"><em><u>But you say</u></em></strong><span style=\"color: #121212;\"> that if a man says to his father or mother, </span><strong style=\"color: #121212;\"><em><u>‘Whatever you would have received from me is Corban’</u></em></strong><span style=\"color: #121212;\"> (that is, a gift devoted to God),</span><br />\n(12) he is no longer permitted to do anything for his father or mother.<br />\n<span style=\"color: #121212;\">(13) </span><em style=\"color: #121212;\"><u>Thus you </u></em><strong style=\"color: #121212;\"><em><u>nullify the word of God</u></em></strong><em style=\"color: #121212;\"><u> by the tradition you have handed down</u></em><span style=\"color: #121212;\">. And you do so in many such matters.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">The Pharisees had passed down a tradition born of their own selfishness. If they claimed a practice or object as Corban, then it was consecrated to God as a deeply sacred gift to Him, which could never be taken back. A priest could deny even his own needy mother and father of food if those goods were already dedicated as Corban, thereby breaking God’s own commandments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“Those who truly celebrate the incarnation of the Lord are not doing what the anti-Christmas crowd suggests.” (#175 &#8211; 16:20)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“This issue is not that tradition is bad, but that if tradition is a means of avoiding scripture, there is a problem.” (#175 &#8211; 15:37)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Nick Campbell is guilty of the very issue that he identified! He is consecrating a pagan tradition as Corban to God, claiming it celebrates His incarnation in the flesh. In doing so, he breaks God’s commandments to not learn the ways of pagan nations or</span><strong style=\"color: #121212;\"><em><u> substitute their traditions as a way of honoring Him</u></em></strong><span style=\"color: #121212;\">. His perversion of thought takes the breath away!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Deuteronomy 12:29-31 BSB</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #121212;\">(29) When the LORD your God cuts off before you the nations you are entering to dispossess, and you drive them out and live in their land,</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #121212;\">(30) be careful not to be ensnared by their ways after they have been destroyed before you. Do not inquire about their gods, asking, </span><strong style=\"color: #121212;\"><em><u>“How do these nations serve their gods?

And so I do recommend everyone studying Romans 14 in detail.” (#148 &#8211; 5:00)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“But by what biblical prohibition can you tell others to not esteem a day or season on to the glory of God? You can&#8217;t. In fact, Paul says quite the opposite.” (#148 &#8211; 8:52)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“Romans 14, five to seven. And right here I just want to emphasize Paul&#8217;s phrase, ‘let each one be fully convinced in his own mind’. So with that said, we can all move on from here.” (#148 &#8211; 9:27)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Case-closed then? Not quite!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Nick Campbell quotes Romans 14 to support his opinion that “conscience and liberty” are enough to justify doing things the Lord declared to be abominable. He abuses it ad nauseam in so many of his podcasts. So, let’s do as he suggests and break down Romans 14 in detail so we can understand exactly what the Apostle Paul was talking about and why Campbell is so wrong to use it as his universal objection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Romans 14:2-7 ESV</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #121212;\">(2) One person believes he may eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #121212;\">(3) Let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains and let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats, for God has welcomed him.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #121212;\">(4) Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. And he will be upheld, for the Lord is able to make him stand.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #121212;\">(5) One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #121212;\">(6) The one who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord. The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since she gives thanks to God, while the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #121212;\">(7) For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Paul was referring only to clean things. Eating or not eating vegetables and clean meats was not in the realm of sin but in personal preference, custom, and conscience. Not so with idolatry and principles contrary to Truth and Biblical Testimony. BIG difference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Nick is talking iniquity (lawlessness), urging everyone to be a law unto themselves.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Keep in mind the time that Paul was writing this. It was a time of major transition. You had both Jew and Gentile believers coming into the fold. For the believers coming from heathen nations, the idea of consuming meat was a previously unclean act for some. This is why there was no requirement placed on them if they were comfortable with just vegetables. They were also not forced into Jewish ceremonies or circumcision.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">“For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements: that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.” (Acts 15:28-29 ESV)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Likewise, the Jews were not prohibited from visiting the Temple or participating in the ceremonies that they had grown up with. This is why Paul brought up </span>the observation of special days, such as the Feast of Tabernacles. Paul still purified himself and others for a brief period at the Temple (Acts 21:26). Yet, at the same time, Paul also publicly rebuked Peter for trying to force Jewish customs on the new Gentile believers (Galatians 2:11).</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">The reason Paul stressed that believers at the time “should be convinced in their own minds” is that doing otherwise for them would be a sin. You would be violating what you know or believe to be right. That was the sole reason for Paul even emphasizing conscience because the matter of eating meat or not wasn’t a defined case of moral law.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">“But the one who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and everything that is not from faith is sin.” (Romans 14:23 BSB)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Paul wrote this guidance for the Jews and Gentiles when it was a weaning period for the young Church. The priesthood was coming to an end, and it was time to move away from the shadows of things to come, into the Reality of living by the Holy Spirit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">For example, older Jewish believers who grew up with the Temple sacrifices, and ceremonial practices, would initially have some difficulty parting with them. Paul advised them that whether they chose to continue these things was left to faith and conscience as they grew more mature in Christ. Eventually that generation of believers concluded, following the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple in 70 A.D.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Paul&#8217;s words were temporary guidance to help the infant Church stabilize, and provide some clarity on what to do when no moral law exists. It was not a carte blanche invitation to follow a corrupted conscience, commit blasphemy, and uphold every unclean thing that the Lord abhors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Keep in mind that when Paul was writing his letters, the pagan precursors to Christmas were being celebrated by the nations he was sent to. Paul certainly would not have condoned the new believers retaining any form of practice to the gods he was actively preaching against.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Of course, Nick Campbell is not the only presumptuous person to twist and abuse Paul’s letters for their own gain, fulfilling Peter’s words (</span>2 Peter 3:16).</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Nick does admit that people shouldn’t celebrate Christmas if they aren’t fully convinced in their own minds and that it would be a sin for them to do so. However, he is blind to how he continues to abuse the verse to serve as one-size-fits-all justification for blasphemy. Despite this, Campbell still marches forward with Romans 14:5. He quotes it at least three other times in Episode #175 to support his other faulty “Biblical” arguments as we will see later.</span></p>\n<h4>Christmas is not adding to the law</h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“So the political rhetoric goes like this: ‘God never speaks of making Christmas a part of Christianity, nor does he say to celebrate the son&#8217;s birth. It is a celebration that is created by men, and thus we are disobeying God by adding to the commandment of God and partaking in the traditions of men’. Heard it a thousand times.” (#175 &#8211; 6:50)</span></p>\n<p>So, the obvious exclusion of a commandment from God is now a license to contemplate doing things which He has not spoken? How arrogant is that? Remarkably, the people that he is complaining about are perfectly correct. So instead, Nick Campbell dismisses them by choosing to reframe the issue to evade criticism:</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“The tradition of Christmas isn&#8217;t comparable as we do not include Christmas in our interpretation of the law, and we do not add it upon the law as a requirement” (#175 &#8211; 14:30)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“First, the Christmas crowd does not add Christmas to the law or its interpretation of the law.” (#175 &#8211; 16:28)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“I won&#8217;t hear the phrase you&#8217;re adding to the commandment of God, because most will happily say that there&#8217;s nothing obligatory, effectual, or salvific about celebrating Christmas.” (#175 &#8211; 7:00)</span></p>\n<p>That is quite a clever workaround, isn’t it? In essence, he is saying: “Well, we aren’t making Christmas obligatory one way or another, so I guess you can’t say we are adding to the law.”</p>\n<p>However, he certainly is <strong><em><u>subtracting</u></em></strong> from the law of God in that he dismisses God’s previous commandments to not practice the customs of pagan nations or adopt them to worship God, as demonstrated before.</p>\n<p>“Whatever I command you, you shall be careful to do; you shall not add to <strong><em><u>nor take away from it.</u></em></strong>” (Deuteronomy 12:32 NASB)</p>\n<p>He abuses Romans 14 here again.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“So with this all said, I and many others would happily say that Christmas is a tradition. We agree, but it is one that is non-binding on individuals. And we join Paul, as he says, let each be fully convinced in his own mind.” (#175 &#8211; 21:12)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“&#8230;the Christmas crowd doesn&#8217;t undermine the law of God because there isn&#8217;t a prohibition against esteeming a particular day, quite contrary to Romans 14 or making a celebration from the work of God.” (#175 &#8211; 16:35)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">His justification is so preposterous that Nick Campbell must support it with outrageous statements like this:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“I have yet to see Christmas added to the list of Christian ordinances for those who support Christmas. In fact, quite the contrary, those who are anti-Christmas tend to give the celebration more weight than those who celebrate it. In regards to the status of those who partake in Christmas.” (#175 &#8211; 7:30)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Most denominations officially add it. Catholics for one, are required to participate in it, going to the Mass and receiving the Eucharist. Even if it isn’t “officially” listed as an ordinance for other denominations, they most certainly treat it as one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Nick Campbell is playing dumb here to avoid confrontation. He used to be an atheist himself, so he understands there is invariably immense social scorn from “Christians” towards those who do not participate in Christmas.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“So who is the legalist one who adds the command of God and holds it over another&#8217;s head?” (#175 &#8211; 7:50)</span></p>\n<p>Who is the one who subtracts from it, Nick?</p>\n<h4>God did not command all celebrations</h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“I would postulate that this happens more often with those who are anti-Christmas. Their argument is simple when you boil it down. If it isn&#8217;t explicitly in Scripture, you shall not partake.” (#175 &#8211; 8:00)</span></p>\n<p>Not only is Christmas not explicit in Scripture, but it is also condemned by Scripture. Why doesn’t Nick see that? Those who limit their argument against Christmas to it not being mentioned fall far short of withstanding heresy and idolatry.</p>\n<p>Is the problem one of choice? Wife rather than God? Wasn’t that Adam’s fall? Nick’s wife plays a repeat of Eve and Nick repeats Adam’s sin. Where did that scenario lead? Look at us!</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“The point is that celebrations are a normal part of human experience. And as Christians, we have God to direct our thanksgiving because of our biblical worldview. Now, if I am honest with the simple reality in mind, it should be a given that celebrating the incarnation of Christ would be acceptable. But of course, I want to demonstrate it.” (#175 &#8211; 18:25)</span></p>\n<p>Nick Campbell tries to refute those who object to practices solely because they are not explicitly mentioned in the Scriptures. He is only partially right to do so. However, Nick believes if he can demonstrate a Biblical example of celebration that was not explicitly directed by God, then that would provide justification for celebrating Christmas as the incarnation of Christ, even though God has not commanded we do so. However, all the examples he gives are spurious:</p>\n<h4>Jesus celebrated Hanukkah</h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“Jesus likely celebrated a holiday feast that’s not found in the Bible!” (#148 &#8211; 17:12)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“&#8230;this text is not merely about celebrating a miraculous work of God, which Jews and perhaps Jesus Himself did happily with the feast of dedication mentioned in John 10:22-23. And that was a celebration focused around an event that occurred during the intertestamental period during the 400 years of silence, and we know it as Hanukkah.” (#175 &#8211; 11:13)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“Romans 14 is another issue to be brought up in this particular discussion.” (#175 &#8211; 20:55)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">Romans 14 again! The truth is that Hanukkah is a rebellious tradition celebrating Israel’s temporary relief from God’s Wrath. Nick </span>Campbell <span style=\"color: #121212;\">is making a lofty assumption, like so many others, that Jesus Christ attended in full support of the festivities.</span></p>\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/teachings/what-about-hanukkah.htm\">What about Hanukkah (Chanukah)?</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“So within the text of John 10:23-24, there is no rebuke for the holiday while Jesus attends. And he is also attending in the Temple. As a Jew, attending during the Feast of Dedication and walking in the courts, there is little to no reason to think that Jesus would not participate.” (#148 &#8211; 18:14)</span></p>\n<p>There was no rebuke because Jesus Christ wasn’t there to celebrate a rebellious man-made holiday. He was there opportunely to address lawless people celebrating their rebellious response to <strong><em><u>His Wrath</u></em></strong>. <span style=\"color: #121212;\">The reason why Hanukkah </span><span style=\"color: #980000;\">&#8220;still goes on to this day”</span>, is because the Jews continue to reject His Word today as they did then.</p>\n<p>Didn’t the Jews even change the candelabra from the Heavenly-dictated 7 lights directed by Moses to the man-devised 9 candles at the time of the Maccabean revolt that ultimately failed?</p>\n<p>Is Nick suggesting that believers should attend Christmas events to address people just as the Lord did at Hanukkah? I don’t think so. He comes to love pleasures more than God and to do so in the Name of God to salve his conscience, follow his wife, and save face.</p>\n<h4>The Synagogues</h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“The truth is that these community centers were never commanded by God and yet were a significant place for worship and religious life.” (#175 &#8211; 11:13)</span></p>\n<p>Is there not a huge difference between building a community center on the one hand and partaking of pagan customs according to pagan gods, on the other? The former is not forbidden though benign while the latter is idolatry. Isn’t the twist Campbell devises similar to the con job the serpent used with Eve?</p>\n<p>Yes, Nick, weave your web, wedge your way, woo the wife, and win the world to worrisome woe with worldly-wise words, just for fun.</p>\n<h4>Ancient Jerusalem</h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“..in the Bible, we have a couple of examples of such celebrations: One being the joy of the completed temple, featured in Ezra 3:10-13”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #121212;\">It was </span>the Temple’s <strong>foundations</strong> that were completed i<span style=\"color: #121212;\">n Ezra 3:10-13 (the final completion of the Temple was much later, noted in Ezra 6:14-15).</span></p>\n<p>“And when the builders <u>laid the foundation of the temple</u> of the LORD, the priests in their vestments came forward with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the LORD, <strong><em><u>according to the directions of David king of Israel.</u></em></strong>” (Ezra 3:10 ESV)</p>\n<p>Even then, what a wicked comparison to make in justifying evil! The work of restoring the Temple was still according to the commandment given to the Jews by God!</p>\n<p>Nick, face it. Your reasonings are of a “perverse generation.”</p>\n<p>God directed everything! He first gave the prophecy to Jeremiah. He stirred the heart of King Cyrus to declare that the Lord had appointed him to build Him a Temple at Jerusalem and to return all stolen items. He moved the hearts of the priests, Levites, their neighbors, the prophets Haggai and Zechariah, the builders, and everyone in Jerusalem. When they finished building the Temple, they dedicated it according to the Law and celebrated Passover, a solemn feast approved and commanded by God at the time. All these good and holy things were appointed and specified from above.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“…and another one in Nehemiah 12:27-43. Nehemiah 12:27-43 is particularly interesting, and I recommend you read a little bit into the background because it&#8217;s excellent.”</span></p>\n<p>Same with the wall of Jerusalem. It was prophesied. Nehemiah has prayed earlier for the Lord to put it in his heart to rebuild the wall. The Lord’s hand was there from the beginning until the end, and it was <strong><em><u>God</u></em></strong> who gave them their joy.</p>\n<p>“And that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced. <strong><em><u>For God had made them rejoice with great joy</u></em></strong>. And the wives and the sons rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.” (Nehemiah 12:43 MKJV)</p>\n<h4>The Birth of Christ</h4>\n<p>This is Nick Campbell’s last example of “Biblical” proof. He tries to argue that a recurring celebration of the incarnation of “God the Son” is allowed, without any direction from God, and takes half the podcast to do so. He outlines the fulfillment of prophetic events from the Scriptures. Essentially, Nick’s argument boils down to “because <strong><em><u>they</u></em></strong> did it, <strong><em><u>we</u></em></strong> should be able to do it too.”</p>\n<p>Mary and Joseph clearly had a reason to be excited. So did Elizabeth, John (while yet in the womb), the shepherds, the angels of the Armies of Heaven, Simeon, Anna, and the wise men. However, all these occurrences were driven by ancient prophecies by Daniel or Jeremiah. Or they were prophesied more recently by Zechariah or the angel Gabriel.</p>\n<p>In every case, there was the very visible Hand of God orchestrating every detail, sending prophets, peoples, angels, and princes. There was a good reason for those involved to have joy when they realized God’s Words had been fulfilled before their very eyes. And they had this wondrous privilege, being the messengers of His revelation.</p>\n<p>However miraculous the moment, it did quickly subside. There wasn’t a recurring celebration in the following years from Mary and Joseph or the angels for the birth of Jesus. Which begs the question, why didn’t they? It would seem they had more reason to celebrate, than any person alive today, yet there is not a single record of a customary, annual festivity. More to the point, God Himself has been dead silent on the issue as well. He didn’t appoint one of His apostles to make any mention of the importance of His birthday in the Scriptures.</p>\n<p>Yet people like Nick Campbell will spend their entire lives searching for answers in the dust and cobwebs, for fragments of parchment in distant lands to search for an answer for the question he already knows the answer to. Silence from God isn’t good enough for him. Nick searches high and low because <strong><em><u>HE</u></em></strong> wants Christmas, just as those in the world want it!</p>\n<p>It is not in God’s Nature to send mixed signals to His children. Rather, through His apostles, He has said this about His time in the flesh:</p>\n<p>“So from now on we regard no one according to the flesh. <em><u>Although we once regarded Christ in this way, </u></em><strong><em><u>we do so no longer.</u></em></strong>” (2 Corinthians 5:16 BSB)</p>\n<p>The apostles knew the Lord in His flesh as the Son, and now they knew Him as the Holy Spirit when He returned to them at Pentecost, just as He promised:</p>\n<p>John 14:15-19 ESV<br />\n(15) If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.<br />\n(16) And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, to be with you forever,<br />\n(17) even the <strong><em><u>Spirit of Truth</u></em></strong>, Whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him. <strong><em><u>You know Him, for He dwells with you</u></em></strong> [Jesus is living with the disciples] and will be in you.<br />\n(18) <strong><u>I will not leave you</u></strong> as orphans; <strong><em><u>I will come to you</u></em></strong>.<br />\n(19) Yet a little while and <strong><u>the world will see Me no more,</u></strong><strong><em><u> but you will see Me</u></em></strong>. Because I live, you also will live.</p>\n<p>They didn’t need to celebrate the fleshy birth of the Savior, their God. They had the Lord, Jesus Christ <strong><em><u>living in them</u></em></strong>! What greater joy could possibly be had?! How much more real could it get?</p>\n<p>When Saul of Tarsus was hunting believers, He was persecuting God Himself, because the Lord Jesus Christ was there, living in the flesh of His children.</p>\n<p>“And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, <strong><em><u>why are you persecuting Me</u></em></strong>?’ So I answered, <strong><em><u>‘Who are You, Lord?</u></em></strong>’ And He said to me, <em><u>‘</u></em><strong><em><u>I am Jesus of Nazareth, Whom you are persecuting.</u></em></strong>’” (Acts 22:7-8 MKJV)</p>\n<p>As such, Paul later helped lay down a way to test those who truly knew the Lord:</p>\n<p>2 Corinthians 13:4-6 BSB<br />\n(4) For He was indeed crucified in weakness, yet He lives by God’s power. And though we are weak in Him, yet by God’s power <strong><em><u>we will live with Him</u></em></strong> to serve you.<br />\n(5) Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. <strong>Can’t you see for yourselves that </strong><strong><em><u>Jesus Christ is in </u></em></strong><strong><u>you</u></strong> — unless you actually fail the test?<br />\n(6) And I hope you will realize that we have not failed the test.</p>\n<p>“By this you will know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that <strong>Jesus Christ has come in the flesh</strong> is from God, and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God.” (1 John 4:2-3 BSB)</p>\n<p>Some of the most wretched people in history have said that Jesus Christ came in a physical body. John certainly wasn’t saying they were of God. So whose flesh was he talking about? The flesh of the <strong><em><u>believer</u></em></strong>. John tested many claiming to be apostles and found them to be phonies. (1 John 4:1, Revelation 2:2). Fellow believers like Paul could not fail the test, because he confessed that Jesus Christ came in his own flesh:</p>\n<p>“I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but <strong><em><u>Christ who lives in me</u></em></strong>. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, Who loved me and gave Himself for me” (Galatians 2:20 ESV).</p>\n<p>So why does a believer need to be reminded of His Promise, when that Promise is living <strong><em><u>IN HIM</u></em></strong>? Do we need to be reminded we have a head? But Nick Campbell says he needs yearly reminders!</p>\n<p>Truly, it is Jesus Christ Who witnesses of Himself in and through His vessel, rather than the believer:</p>\n<p>“Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of prophecy” (Revelation 19:10 NKJV)</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #980000;\">“Now, surely the coming of the high priest, Prophet, and King &#8211; God the Son Incarnate anticipated for centuries &#8230; Now I would postulate that we all know that this is worthy of celebration, and we celebrate it constantly when we recall the gospel in our lives. Because without the incarnation of Christ, there would be no gospel for us. So with such an obvious statement, the debate actually becomes, can we have an annual celebration where we can refocus ourselves and reflect upon this work. Surely we can, according to the functions of festivals in the Old Testament, right? That was their function to have these reminders yearly.” (#148 &#8211; 20:21)</span></p>\n<p>There is a massive difference between a God-ordained festival and adopting pagan traditions to worship God. One is obedience and the other is blasphemy! One is Lawful piety and the other, rebellion, which is as witchcraft (1 Samuel 15:22,23, KJV).</p>\n<p>Nick Campbell is looking for reminders of something <strong><em><u>he doesn’t have and doesn’t understand</u></em></strong>. He has never known the Lord Jesus Christ personally, living as part of His Body. As such, Nick can only presume to imagine what the reality of the Godhead is, which is why he believes in the carnal reasonings of <a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/falsehood-exposed/trinity/index.htm\">The Trinity</a>, revealing his fatal error.</p>\n<p>He believes that God is three separate “persons”, and that “God the Son” took on flesh, rather than the truth &#8211; which is that God the “Father” (single Person), took on flesh in His role as the Son. The Lord Jesus Christ, Father God, is One Lord, one Person.</p>\n<p>“Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God <strong><em><u>is ONE LORD</u></em></strong>” (Deuteronomy 6:4 KJV)</p>\n<p>“I looked, but there was no one to help; I was appalled, but there was no one to uphold; so <strong><em><u>My Own Arm brought Me salvation</u></em></strong>, and My Wrath upheld Me.” (Isaiah 63:5 ESV)</p>\n<p>“I have not learned wisdom, and I have no knowledge of the <strong><em><u>Holy One</u></em></strong>. <strong><em><u>Who has ascended to heaven and come down</u></em></strong>? Who has gathered the wind in His hands? Who has bound up the waters in His cloak? Who has established all the ends of the earth? <strong><em><u>What is His Name</u></em></strong>, and <strong><em><u>what is the Name of His Son</u></em></strong>—surely you know!” (Proverbs 30:3-4 BSB)</p>\n<p>“Jesus said to him, Have I been with you such a long time and yet you have not known Me, Philip? <strong><em><u>He who has seen Me has seen the Father</u></em></strong>. And how do you say, Show us the Father?” (John 14:9 MKJV)</p>\n<p>“For unto us a <strong><em><u>Child</u></em></strong> is born, Unto us a <strong><em><u>Son</u></em></strong> is given; And the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, <strong><em><u>Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace</u></em></strong>.” (Isaiah 9:6 MKJV)</p>\n<p>Nick doesn’t have the first clue as to the Nature of the Lord Jesus Christ, our God. He is denying Jesus Christ was the Father come in the flesh, our Savior. He is calling Jesus Christ a liar when He says “I and the Father are One and the Same.” As such, he denies both the Son <strong>and</strong> Father (1 John 2:22-23)</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Nick Campbell, who admits he is no expert, poorly attempts to make “historical” and “Biblical” arguments for celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ with a holiday the world now knows as “Christmas”. The evidence he brings is entirely based on myth, massive assumption, “tradition”, the testimony of liars, carelessness, and his own arrogance. In short, he greatly errs.</p>\n<p>Nick ignores the Lord’s strict commandments not to partake in any custom or tradition of pagan nations and does so anyway. To make matters worse, he merchandises his asinine theories to his ignorant listeners.</p>\n<p>So what should a believer do on December 25th or any of the other days the world highly esteems (Luke 16:15)? Don’t worry about it. You simply treat it like any other ordinary day and go out by faith as the Lord Jesus Christ has instructed. If His Spirit rests in you, He will certainly make known His will. His sheep <strong>do</strong> hear His Voice.</p>\n<p>There are dozens of other points that could have been made but were not.

I’ll check it out. Not sure I appreciate the label false teachers over matters of conscience, but nonetheless- I appreciate the feedback!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ronnie said:</p>\n<p>Nick, questioning being labeled as a false teacher based on “matters of conscience” only demonstrates what we’ve said. You’re trivializing and ignoring the commands of God, and instead turning them into “matters of conscience” where one can pick and choose what they do. It’s the equivalent of making adultery a “matter of conscience.” God is clear about heathen festivals and worshiping Him as heathens worship their gods. It’s all there in the papers I’ve shared with you.</p>\n<p>And even if it was only a matter of conscience, unrelated to God’s moral commands, doesn’t a man’s conscience before God determine whether or not he sins? Isn’t that what Paul said in Romans 14, the text you erroneously cited for your argument? There is simply no fear of God with you. It’s all a cerebral exercise in doctrine and doing as you please. Your video trailer makes an open mockery of those who might, in their conscience before God, abstain from these traditions. You say “History!” as if that has anything to do with God’s commands or a man’s conscience. You’re wrong on all points, history included. Can you imagine Paul the apostle treating new believers like you are, even in matters of eating or drinking? And you presume to teach and instruct others! Need we say anything more? We do. Read the link and tell us how much you &#8220;appreciate&#8221; the feedback.</p>\n[END COMMENTS]\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nick deleted the video he had posted along with all the above comments.  He then posted a link to this paper but later deleted it and replaced it with this post:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/christthecure/posts/5693583753990660\">https://www.facebook.com/christthecure/posts/5693583753990660</a></p>\n<p><em>***Update: I removed the original post with the article. The more I learned about the group, the less attention I wanted them to get.***</em></p>\n<p><em>I was considering responding more fully to the aforementioned article that I was featured in as a false teacher, but after combing through it I realized quickly there wasn’t a point. I’m not particularly sure I want to give them attention (so I&#8217;m not even going to post the article again). So, here’s a brief tid-bit of the thoughts I typed up:</em></p>\n<p><em>I was recently featured on a website as a false teacher. My company on this list of false teachers was interesting to say the least. Some of the false teachers were legitimate false teachers, but some of them were not.</em></p>\n<p><em>Many on the list are merely those who are orthodox, that is, they hold to the biblical and historical articulation of the Christian faith. The reason is simple, the website is run by modalists, an interesting breed no less where the head of the website sees himself as a prophet by the looks of it. Of course, we know that Modalism is a heresy universally condemned in historic Christendom for its incoherence. I plan on talking about modalism in the future quite a bit, and so we won’t here, but a simple reading through the New Testament shows how modalism makes God&#8217;s revelation of Himself arbitrary, doubtful, and incoherent.</em></p>\n<p><em>What was the topic of discussion in relation to me? My episodes on Christmas, to which there is only one up publicly ever since the relaunch a few weeks back (so they had this piece prepped for a while before publishing).</em></p>\n<p><em>I must say, I&#8217;m quite disappointed that my charge as a false teacher comes, firstly from a matter of religious liberty, and conscience, rather than my adherence to what the Bible reveals about the Godhead.</em></p>\n<p><em>Condemn me as a stout trinitarian, please, not for disagreeing with you on Christmas.</em></p>\n<p><em>What you&#8217;ll find in this article is what amounts to a smear piece. It is a lengthy one, that has a lot of words, but doesn&#8217;t really say much. The article would have been better if it properly represented my arguments and lacked the polemical emotionalism that it was laced in. It also made some strange mistakes in basic details like calling Hippolytus of Rome, Hippolytus of Athens (who was a figure in Greek Mythology). It didn&#8217;t refute my points really, but actually strengthened them or merely dismissed them because they didn&#8217;t like the people involved in my assessment, i.e. Tertullian. The strongest argument dealt with the document linked to Hippolytus, yet, they lost the point when being inconsistent later. Essentially, they questioned the validity of Hippolytus of Rome&#8217;s document because it was a late copy, yet they take a copy of the Chronograph as evidence for their claim while simultaneously making mistakes on their claim while plagiarizing another website.</em></p>\n<p><em>And of course the article makes me sound like a madman:</em></p>\n<p><em>“Yet people like Nick Campbell will spend their entire lives searching for answers in the dust and cobwebs, for fragments of parchment in distant lands to search for an answer for the question he already knows the answer to. Silence from God isn’t good enough for him. Nick searches high and low because HE wants Christmas, just as those in the world want it!”</em></p>\n<p><em>[I’m not sure why this rhetoric is so popular. Is it supposed to make me sound like a fanatic? I spend a few months studying a subject and all of a sudden my entire life is dedicated to it?]</em></p>\n<p><em>To be frank, however, if I&#8217;m speaking to a Modalist, my last concern is what they think about Christmas. Actually, when speaking to a Modalist, most anything else is of least concern.</em></p>\n<p><em>One observation I did want to point out is a consistent inconsistency that I had to chuckle at, if I&#8217;m honest.</em></p>\n<p><em>When you read through the article you&#8217;ll see no mention of any sources except for one, Alexander Hislop’s “Two Bablyons.&#8221; Search his name on their website, and he’s recommended a number of times as having penned a great work. I&#8217;ve discussed him a number of times now and so I&#8217;m just going to leave that there. Moving on, he is the presupposition driving the article despite his historical work being rejected by many, and once you recognize that, it&#8217;s clear.</em></p>\n<p><em>In the article, you&#8217;ll see the Modalist reject Tertullian&#8217;s credibility because he believed Sunday was the day of the resurrection and held that it was the lord’s day for worship. Not only that, but he also that the Lord’s second coming was far off, not something to be had presently, and thus he isn&#8217;t credible according to them.</em></p>\n<p><em>Additionally, Hippolytus is rejected as credible because he opposed&#8230; Modalism. Of course, Tertullian was also a major proponent against Modalism (I’m not sure why they didn’t mention that), but I digress because of course all of the church condemned Modalism, and rightly so!</em></p>\n<p><em>Further, I’m critiqued for using the history of the Donatists in my evaluation, and the authors state, because they were heretics, “why does Nick think these people serve as good witnesses to make an argument for clean worship.” Aside for misunderstanding or twisting my argument, this will be fatal argument for the authors.</em></p>\n<p><em>Around the end of the article, Spurgeon is called a corrupt man who praised Calvin and Calvin is called a rabid murderer. In their article against Calvin (cited in my debut on their website) they praise Servetus for speaking against infant baptism as a doctrine of the devil, the invention of the popery, and a total subversion of Christianity. One of the contributors notes, “Infant baptism is one of many diabolical inventions of men christened by the devil who comes as an angel of light and so on.” They also praise Servetus in his denial of trinitarianism.</em></p>\n<p><em>Yet, their single source against me, Alexander Hislop, was ironically&#8230;. a Presbyterian, Calvinistic, infant baptizing, trinitarian (who oddly argued that every religion had a type or shadow of the trinity including Hinduism), who held to a Sunday resurrection, and the second advent being distant. Not only so, but he wrote in defense for most all of these things!</em></p>\n<p><em>A rudimentary level of research on Hislop would show the authors that their own source, according to their own standards, is unreliable in their argumentation. Of course, his history in the &#8220;Two Babylons&#8221; is famously noted, even by wikipedia, as having no claim of being accurate by historians.</em></p>\n<p><em>So, if we treat sources the way our Modalists  do, then we must discredit their entire presupposition that Christmas predates the NT via Bablyon, and thus the article, since they provided one single source who is against much of what they hold to. According to themselves, he is a product of the devil and we should avoid him, and we would be crazy to trust him, and by extension them.</em></p>\n<p><em>More difficult, however, is that I cannot quote any evidences for this because those who I can think of are heretics and unreliable according to the modalists (even if they disagree with me on Christmas). Basically, the Modalists are right, because they said so, and they are the standard.</em></p>\n<p><em>The internet is a strange place. Apologies for typos, it&#8217;s late or I&#8217;m tired. I&#8217;m not sure.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Comments that followed:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Bogus</strong></p>\n<p>I read your book about the holidays and felt it was an honest review.

I thought you tried to look at it from all the different angles and while you gave your own thoughts, I felt like you left it open for people too make their own conclusion and choices, and never once did I feel as if you presented that we had to quit fellowshipping together because we came to a different conclusions.</p>\n<p><strong>Christ is the Cure</strong></p>\n<p>Kevin Bogus well that’s encouraging because that’s all I really wanted to accomplish</p>\n<p><strong>Christian Walton</strong></p>\n<p>You know, I haven&#8217;t read the article on you: but I think I know the guy you&#8217;re talking about.</p>\n<p>If it is the guy you&#8217;re talking about, I&#8217;ve read him before and that man is a blasphemous lunatic who desperately needs Christ.</p>\n<p><strong>Christ is the Cure</strong></p>\n<p>Christian Walton there’s certainly some weird ideas over there to say the least</p>\n<p><strong>Christian Walton</strong><br />\nChrist is the Cure I found the article and confirmed my suspicion: I was right.</p>\n<p>That dude&#8217;s hatred of sound theology comes from the pits of hell. We gotta pray for him.</p>\n<p><strong>Marcie Morris</strong></p>\n<p>I have literally spent the second half of my day reading their site, their articles and their reasons for calling people false teachers. Nick is in good company on this site. In addition to him, other “false teachers” include Paul Washer, John MacArthur, Alistair Begg, Tim Challies, John Calvin, Walter Martin, John Piper and many others.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that they have countless comments on their articles of people calling them out in their false teachings. Numerous people noting the same takeaway that I did after reading their stuff &#8211; no one is correct but them. If anyone believes something they don’t believe, it means they’re of the devil and have never experienced Christ. Which is a regurgitated claim in almost every article I read-that none of these people “know the Lord Jesus personally”, a claim he also made of Nick.</p>\n<p>I’ve read both versions of Nicks Holidays and the Feasts book which came from the episodes quoted in this article (and I’ve also listened to the episodes numerous times) and I can say with 100% certainty that they have twisted everything Nick said. There’s so much straw I can’t see straight.</p>\n<p>Their Modalism is what condemns them. Of the Trinity they said:</p>\n<p>“Trinity worshipers demand that Christians bow to this abomination made in the likeness of their own confusion. In this section we expose the idolaters and their idol in order to liberate those held hostage to damnable lies.” Their list of false teachers isn’t surprising given this is what they believe.</p>\n<p><strong>Lindsey Dixon</strong><br />\nMarcie Morris I didn’t spend long, but there were also actual false teachers notably absent.</p>\n<p><strong>Top fan</strong><br />\n<strong>Rachael Chen</strong></p>\n<p>dont worry, those who actually read the Bible, have the Holy Spirit and take an honest look at your work will be able to discern that you&#8217;re not a false teacher</p>\n<p><strong>JP Manzi</strong></p>\n<p>He literally is not worth your time to reply. His views are odd to put it mildly</p>\n<p><strong>Christ is the Cure</strong><br />\nJP Manzi yeah, I’m discovering that &#8211; there’s some lofty claims on their website</p>\n<p><strong>Maddie Rose</strong></p>\n<p>We live in a day where people have to be discerning about people who claim to be discerning. It should be a red flag when a website or organization, or person is solely engaged in calling out false teachers. Discernment is part of ministry but these people are like tabloids, getting attention and garnering a following for lies and slander.</p>\n<p><strong>Edmar Conroy</strong></p>\n<p>This is not stereotypical but there is no proper argumentation with these people.

What a surprise! What could that be? Negotiations? Peace talks and treaties? Compromises? Trading resources and rights? Ukraine’s surrender? No, none of the above.</p>\n<p>Is it prayer? Is it turning to God? Yes, and no, not directly. I don’t understand. Well, the answer sounds so banal, so bizarre, yet so obviously true. Nor can this answer apply to any other adversarial situation like Jews and Muslims in the Middle East, Left and Right, or China and Taiwan and Hong Kong, India and Pakistan.</p>\n<p>This answer is… wait for it – to love one another. Russians and Ukrainians, you are brothers. You are of one blood. Don’t you know? Let there be no divisions between you. Love and forgive one another. Begin, set yourselves to do good to one another, to look to your brother’s good as your own.</p>\n<p>Would you help someone you cared for who is in need, like your immediate family? That’s what each of you must do for each other now. You must begin to love one another. Set yourselves individually to do good, no matter what has happened in your history to this present day. It begins with one person, then goes on to the next, and the next. Let the love, the fire of goodwill and action spread, beginning with the smallest of thoughts and acts. Start to displace acts and attitudes of hatred, self-pity, resentment, bitterness, anger, fear, and vengeance with care, consideration, forgiveness, patience, tolerance, and love.</p>\n<p>Can you love your neighbor? Can you love your brother and sister? By God’s grace, yes you can, no matter the past, no matter the “scorecard,” no matter the heinous crimes committed against one another. Begin to love your neighbor.</p>\n<p>This is God’s Command; it is His Solution; it is His Answer for the Ukrainians and Russians.</p>\n<p>Why has this answer come to me? I don’t know. I’m Ukrainian, 4th generation in Canada, born and raised in a Ukrainian social, linguistic, agricultural, cultural, religious, psychological environment in Manitoba, Canada. Could that be why I’m thinking and feeling this way? I don’t see it, but maybe. I know I’ve been separated from Ukraine as have been my parents and perhaps even my grandparents. There may be an element of that, granted; however, I think it’s because God has appointed this hour, this duty for me to speak something way beyond me. I wasn’t pondering these matters, except that in the news we were watching events unfold as Russia came to invade Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Understand, I’m not on either side, even though I’m Ukrainian. I don’t blame the Ukrainians and I don’t blame Vladimir Putin or the Russians. Both have been a hard people, full of cruelty and fault but I don’t blame them for who they’ve been, what they’ve done generally, or what they’ve done towards one another in the present or past. This is no call or time for blame now; it is a call and the time to love your brother, to love your neighbor, to forgive. Now is the time.</p>\n<p>This is a strange step. You’d think people would be called to repentance, to stop sinning, to fast and pray, to cry out to God, all good, necessary, and true. However, it’s as though God is calling on people to take the first step. To try to do what’s right. He’s calling on you, Russians, and you, Ukrainians to start to do the right, and do you must, or you’ll destroy yourselves.</p>\n<p>And why you people? Why not the Americans or Europeans or Chinese or the United Kingdom nations, or the many adversarial situations such as colonists and aboriginals, Jews and Gentiles, Japanese and Chinese, British and French, British Canadians and Quebecers, blacks and whites, Dems and Republicans, and so forth? But no, God has decided to begin with the Russians and Ukrainians in an hour of great trial and conflict, of warfare, of blood, clouds, fire, and smoke.</p>\n<p>Does Japheth, one of the three of Noah’s sons, the original ancestor of the Slavic nations, have anything to do with it? I don’t know. All I know is this is where it begins or is happening.</p>\n<p>Why not in the Middle East with Jews and Muslim Arabs? After all, isn’t that where the center of human conflict begins with man pitted against God, right around where God established the Garden of Eden and created the first man in His image, where Adam and Eve then disobeyed God, where man was cursed, and where Cain killed Abel, in the land of the Bible? Why not beginning with Israel, as we have seen and thought, from where came the Law of God, the Bible, and the Messiah of Israel and the world?</p>\n<p>Speaking of the Jews, a people scattered to the ends of the earth by their God, there’s where you, Ukrainians and Russians, begin. You begin to do good to the Jew first. You begin to love and not hate them. You begin to make reparations and restitution to the Jews you’ve so hated and drastically persecuted throughout centuries. You begin to help them, heal them, restore their pillaged and stolen goods, present and past, as far as you know and can go. They are the neighbor you least appreciated, to put it mildly.</p>\n<p>Knowingly or ignorantly, you have hated God’s chosen people, the Jews. True, they have not been innocent. In this world, both the best and the worst have come from the Jews, the race chosen by God to be His. You must now turn to love them. You will find favor with God, according to Genesis 12:3, where God spoke to Abram, the father of the Jews:</p>\n<p>“I’ll bless those who bless you, but I’ll curse the one who curses you, and through you, all the people of the earth will be blessed.”</p>\n<p>That is the Eternal Word of God, Ukrainians, Russians, and all people. Believe it, and the moment you do and act accordingly, you will begin to be blessed. That is an ironclad guarantee no man can annul.<br />\nBegin to restore the Jew in your land, and everywhere you can find and bless him, do so, and God will begin to take every opportunity to forgive, bless, and restore you.</p>\n<p>Russians, Ukrainians, and all related and surrounding peoples, do this and you will live and prosper. Love first the Jew, then your peoples, your adversaries, those who have done you evil, and to those you’ve done evil. Don’t wait for them to make the first move. YOU must take the initiative.</p>\n<p>You are being asked to do the impossible. How can I forgive and do good to someone who destroys me and my family, even without cause or provocation? How can I do such a thing? It’s impossible. I can’t. And you can’t. But start. Just try. With men these things are impossible, but with God, all things are possible:</p>\n<p>Matthew 19:26 NIV:</p>\n<p>Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”</p>\n<p>Thus says the Lord: “Love your brother, your neighbor, your enemy. Forgive them their offenses against you and I will immediately begin to love you and forgive your offenses against Me.”</p>\n<p>Matthew 6:14,15:</p>\n<p>14 “For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15 But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.”</p>\n<p>Eternal Truth. No more blame, which everyone deserves, only love and forgiveness. Success and peace are guaranteed. Russians and Ukrainians, wherever you are, whether Ukrainians in Ukraine or Russia, Russians in Russia or Ukraine, whether religious or secular, believers or atheists, rich or poor, you are now all called to love your neighbor and to be no respecters of persons. Do it and you’ll not only live but you’ll also be blessed.</p>\n<p>All these centuries, you’ve lived under God’s wrath for what you as nations have done against the Jews, your brothers, and neighbors, people who have sought refuge from you. Because you have hated the Jews, God has turned you against yourselves, against one another.</p>\n<p>In obedience to this message of God, you will begin to enjoy with thankfulness the remarkable contrast between God’s wrath and His blessing. You’ll begin to marvel at the Accuracy and Truth of His Word as written in the Holy Scriptures. You will begin to say, “God LIVES!” You’ll be turning from lawlessness, proving to yourselves and others that God’s Law, God’s Truth, God’s Love, works, and nothing else does. You’ll KNOW! You’ll be blessed and not cursed. Amen! Thus says the Lord!</p>\n<p><strong>GOD’S ANSWER WHY</strong>: I had been pondering why God was calling the Russians and Ukrainians to stop fighting, and love and forgive one another. Why them? Then it occurred to me on March 2, I believe.</p>\n<p>All of mankind is a brotherhood, as the Scriptures declare, and the Russians and Ukrainians are of the same household. And suddenly, there is this war between them on a serious scale. Siblings in this house have gone to a serious battle where they could destroy themselves in their fury and likely drag the rest of the world into a terrible conflict.</p>\n<p>It’s a matter of God, the Father of all, the parent in the household, shouting to striving siblings, “Hey! Stop it! Somebody will get badly hurt!” Just as many of us have experienced in our homes. There’s no mystery to this, after all; it’s perfectly understandable that God should speak to them in urgency at this time.</p>\n<p>Victor Hafichuk</p>\n<!-- relpost-thumb-wrapper --><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><!-- filter-class --><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><!-- relpost-block-container --><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/letters/the-perishing-smell-death-from-gods-servants.htm\"class=\"relpost-block-single\" ><div class=\"relpost-custom-block-single\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 275px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"<b>The Perishing Smell Death from God&apos;s Servants</b>\"  style=\"background: transparent url(https://www.thepathoftruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/w1-small.png) no-repeat scroll 0% 0%; width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-single-text\"  style=\"font-family: Helvetica;  font-size: 12px;  color: #333333;\"><b>The Perishing Smell Death from God&apos;s Servants</b><br/>From: Berehanu \r\nTo: The Path of Truth\r\nSent: Thursday, May 12, 2016 6:49 AM\r\nSubject: O!

John14:16  I find with most churches there two commandments that have been replaced.  The 1st commandment and the fourth commandment.   1st commandment , we shouldn't make a man-made god, we have (the guy on portraits around the world we teach he is Jesus). Fourth commandment remember the Sabbath to keep it holy,the seventh day.  It was instituted before sin came in the world. Genesis 2:2. When Jesus redeemed us He rested on theSabbath and rose on the first day  It is a sovereign law.

23:30-32)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">肯尼斯·萊克奇寫作《看哪，這個人！》充當機會，來反駁人對於耶穌基督是誰的屬肉體宗教觀念，通過明顯地表明祂的身份：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“報好信息的錫安哪，要登高山；報好信息的耶路撒冷啊，要極力揚聲。揚聲不要懼怕，對猶大的城鎮說：<strong><em>「看哪，你們的神！」</em></strong>” (以賽亞書 40:9)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">我們的理解不是來自人或來自我們自己的個人<a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/chinese/opinion_chinese.htm\"><u>觀點</u></a>，而是來自上帝祂自己，即永恆的真理。人對祂和祂的聖言的解釋絕對不行：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「你們首先要知道這一點：經上的一切預言都不是出於人自己的解釋。」(彼得後書 1:20)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">靈，祂創造了肉體上的視力，敞開了我們對祂在屬靈事上的眼：</p>\n<p>哥林多前書 2:11-16<br />\n(11) 除了在人裏頭的靈，誰知道人的事？照樣，除了神的靈，也沒有人知道　神的事。<br />\n(12) 我們所領受的並不是世上的靈，而是從神來的靈，為使我們知道神把恩賜賞給我們的事。<br />\n(13) 我們也講說這些事，不是用人的智慧所教的言語，而是用靈所教的言語，用屬靈的話解釋屬靈的事。<br />\n(14) 然而，屬血氣的人不接受神的靈的事，他反倒以這為愚拙，並且他不能了解，因為這些事惟有屬靈的人才能領悟。<br />\n(15) 屬靈的人能看透萬事，卻沒有一人能看透他。<br />\n(16) 「誰曾知道主的心？誰會教導祂？」至於我們，我們有基督的心。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">第二條誡命禁止我們用猜想和意見來形成上帝的形象。這就是拜偶像的形成。人無法通過他在自己的想像中構想出來的東西來描繪、傳達或準確傳導上帝的本質。在這樣做的過程中，他只是將自己形成為上帝，並且可能在不知不覺中褻瀆神，就像萊克奇在他的文章一樣，也順序導致其他人褻瀆神。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">萊克奇的文章有兩個重大的錯誤：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>第一</strong>，萊克奇談到主時，好像主在祂肉身的日子裡，與其他任何人都沒有什麼分別。然而，根據主的本質和存在，萊克奇完全錯了：</p>\n<p>「這樣一位聖潔、沒有邪惡、毫無玷汙、與罪人分開、高過諸天的大祭司，對我們實在是合宜的。」(希伯來書 7:26)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>第二</strong>，萊克奇將主作為一個可以效法的榜樣。然而，對於出生於肉體的人來說，效法耶穌基督是不可能的。你必須從靈而生才能去跟從祂，這不是要效法祂，而是要跟從祂隨即所領導哪裡的地方。在這方面，祂使那些與祂合而為一的人像祂一樣得勝，正如祂與父合而為一。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">觸犯上帝的律法是一件很嚴重的事，通過使坐在天上寶座上的那一位成為一個虛假的形象。通過在人們面前玷污哪聖潔和不朽的，假先知剝奪人生命，而不是為他們帶來生命，這只有在真正的主耶穌基督和祂的福音才能找到。你可以肯定沒有其他基督、福音或方式能夠有好的結果：</p>\n<p>申命記 29:19-20<br />\n(19) 這樣的人聽見這詛咒的話，心裏還慶幸，說：『我雖然隨着頑固的心行事，卻還是平安無事。』<br />\n(20) 主必不願饒恕他；主的怒氣與妒忌必向他如煙冒出，將這書上所寫的一切詛咒都加在他身上，主也要從天下塗去他的名。</p>\n<h3>對文章《看哪，這個人！》的回應：</h3>\n<p><strong>「主的榮耀必要顯現，所有的人都必一同看見，因為這是主親口說的。」(以賽亞書 40:5)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>耶穌基督是誰？</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">在這篇文章中，肯尼斯·萊克奇介紹了亞瑟·亞當斯的教導和觀點，即耶穌基督與全人類共享一個墮落的本性，並且受到罪的詛咒，就像任何其他人一樣脆弱，以便成為一個合適的榜樣。根據萊克奇和亞當斯的說法，耶穌基督是上帝的兒子，雖然本質上不如亞當 (在墮落之前)，但毫無疑問，祂不是上帝本身。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">然而，這是我的回答：如果你看到一隻像鴨子一樣走路的鳥，像鴨子一樣游水，像鴨子一樣飛翔，像鴨子一樣嘎嘎叫，那麼你必須得出結論，它是一隻鴨子。如果你看到一個像上帝一樣行走的人，像上帝一樣說話，做上帝的作為，並擁有上帝的每一個屬性，那麼你就看見了上帝。這就是耶穌基督親自在祂一個要求見父的門徒接近時所說的話：</p>\n<p>約翰福音 14:8-11<br />\n(8) 腓力說：「主啊，將父顯給我們看，我們就滿足了。」<br />\n(9) 耶穌對他說：「腓力，我與你們在一起這麼久了，你還不認識我嗎？看見我的就是看見了父，你怎麼還說『將父顯給我們看』呢？<br />\n(10) 我在父裏面，父在我裏面，你不信嗎？我對你們所說的話不是憑着自己說的，而是住在我裏面的父在做祂的工作。<br />\n(11) 你們要信我，我在父裏面，父在我裏面；即使不信，也要因我所做的工作信我。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">如果你正在尋找神性，你正在看著神，即使你不認出你所看到的。上帝是一個靈，而不是血肉，血肉的不理解祂。你不能憑外在的肉體眼睛看到神性 (上帝)，而是憑內在的屬靈啟示。這就是宗教界出現很多混亂的地方，就像亞當斯錯誤的教導所表明的那樣。人們正在利用他們的肉體感官來描繪他們不認識的上帝。耶穌基督，那上帝的本性以人的形式完全表現出來的，只有通過上帝打開我們的靈性眼睛才能看出來。當彼得說耶穌是永生神的兒子時，這就是耶穌所說的：</p>\n<p>「約拿的兒子西門，你是蒙福的，因為這不是血和肉啟示你的，而是我在天上的父啟示你的。」(馬太福音 16:17)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">對萊克奇和亞當斯的反駁，我會用經文和無可辯駁的邏輯清楚地表明耶穌基督是全能的上帝，儘管祂以人的身份出現在肉身中，但並不是他們所聲稱的普通人。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌基督不是第二個神，副神，半神，準神，或三位一體神的一部分，而祂正是上帝，萬主之主，萬物的創造者。當祂以肉身而來時，從未有過任何像祂一樣的人，從此也沒有。如果現在有任何人像祂，那是因為那個人已經重生，領受了祂的靈 — 正如耶穌在祂肉身，是由上帝的靈所生的。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">我將回答亞當斯、萊克奇和同伴提出的許多反對意見，以反對耶穌基督是上帝（這些反對意見對許多人來說是共同的) 和他們生命的主，還有其它錯誤，以便你可以肯定知道耶穌基督確實是全能的上帝，並且你可以通過祂與上帝達到和平。</p>\n<p><strong>人的版本——童話般的宗教</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:

justify;\">對於威爾斯和許多人來說，基督只是一個歷史人物，祂教導人如何跟從上帝。根據威爾斯的說法，在耶穌升天之後，門徒們依靠自己有限的資源去理解和表達祂的教導。因為是低等，沒過多久他們就搞砸了。威爾斯稱這種失敗是「背離信仰。」</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">這種信仰不是註定會失敗嗎？那些低劣的本質如何變得優越？一個人可以由他的靴襻把自己抬起來嗎 (自力更生)？基督，因為祂的優越性，來為全世界捨命，被稱為所有人的救主，怎麼可能連最親近祂的人都無法幫助「把它做好」？不是祂選擇了他們嗎？祂不是有說祂會保守他們嗎？</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">威爾斯是在稱基督為騙子或無能者，或兩者兼而有之。如果人無能為力去跟從祂，那上帝派遣祂的兒子來是否明智嗎？但這正是上帝派遣祂的原因！救主是上帝的大能，將不信的人轉變為上帝的忠實和得勝的子女。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">經文講述了後一個故事，與威爾斯對所發生的事情的不信感知完全不同。使徒行傳記載五旬節那天基督的信徒如何被聖靈充滿，此後被賦予能力去做祂的工作，表現得像基督不僅在場，而在於他們，因為祂是！</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">威爾斯的立場總結了人類的不信，那就是：耶穌基督被載入史冊，因此，已曾並且不再是親自在場，通過祂在內之靈的能力工作，在那些信祂的人。現在是人為己; 任何宣稱基督的人都是靠自己盡力效法主。這與耶穌對祂的信徒說 (「我天天與你們同在，直到世代的終結」) 和他們的見證相反：</p>\n<p>使徒行傳 4:27-30<br />\n(27) 「事實上，希律和本丟‧彼拉多，與外邦人和以色列子民果然在這城裡一同聚集，對付祢所膏立的聖僕耶穌，<br />\n(28) 做成了祢手和祢計劃所預定要成就的一切事。<br />\n(29) 主啊，現在求祢鑒察他們的威嚇，使祢的奴僕們能滿有膽量地傳講祢的話語。<br />\n(30) <strong>求</strong><strong><em>祢伸出祢的手，藉著祢聖子耶穌的名</em></strong><strong>，使疾病痊癒，施行神蹟和奇事。</strong>」</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">使徒保羅說，不是他做了這些事，而是居住在他裡面的基督 (哥林多前書15:9)。那不是效法。保羅的信仰不是在於按威爾斯所描述基督教信仰的方式遵守戒律，因此，據他說，保羅沒達到基督的目標，因為他沒有完成任務，是一個能力較弱的人。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">遵守戒律像上帝一樣，是保羅在他認識基督<strong><em>之前</em></strong>所做的事，當他迫害上帝的教會，神秘的基督身體。正是在保羅轉離死的宗教，從按照他自己的能力和解釋，依照律法的字條生活，轉向依靠信上帝的兒子而生活之後，使他有上帝的能力來過耶穌的生活。而後，他說：「因為我活著就是基督」(腓立比書1:21)。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">對萊克奇和威爾斯來說，他們倆非常相像都對真正信仰的存在無知，他們認為這是一個效仿和做對的事情，因為在人之前有耶穌的榜樣可以效仿。這個模型應該激發人類表達天生的敬虔 — 如果在那方面有任何質量低劣，活該。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">事實上，耶穌基督所過的生活與人類可能的任何事情相去甚遠，以至於那些開始感覺祂如何生活和祂所做的事情的人來說，這恰恰與激發人心相反。試圖通過效法祂的榜樣來達到祂的敬虔狀態是徹底使垂頭喪氣。如果你被鎖在一個有爐子、鍋和一把稻草的房間裡，你效法基督的成功不會比你捏造黃金更成功。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">你能不犯罪嗎？也許你認為你不在犯罪。那個富有的青年官員認為他遵守了所有的律法，就像大數人掃羅一樣。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">那這個怎麼樣呢？你能不能把你親近的人和你的一切都拋棄了，召集十二個信徒，讓他們也拋棄他們親近的人和他們的一切來跟從你，帶他們上路，在公共場所自由講道，回答和治愈任何來找你的人，並提供給那些和你在一起的人？你能命令風停止並在水上行走嗎？你可以在被所有人誤解之下，甚至被你最親密的同伴誤解，仍然保持你的方向，並一心一意信靠著上帝前進？你能儘管在不相信你的「自我任命」講道的宗教勢力致命的反對之下獲勝嗎？你能刻意地引起公憤的困境，知道你會被鞭打和釘死在十字架上，為那些恨你的人捨棄你的生命嗎？你可以捨命，然後自己從死裡復活嗎？能不能說，無論是施洗約翰還是摩西，最偉大的先知都不值得解開你的鞋帶嗎？除了你以外，沒有人能夠來到上帝面前嗎？</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">像萊克奇和亞當斯這樣的人是如何對於基督受騙了，他們假定說，你只要效法祂，你就可以和祂一樣？除了他們不知道他們在說什麼，並且不想知之外，還有什麼理由呢？他們可能宣稱相信祂，但他們不。他們相信他們自己。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">他們認識基督只是在知識、追逐私利上，以他們自己的形象塑造祂，並稱該形象為「耶穌基督。」他們實際上在說：「我等同於基督。我可以做祂所做的事。」由於基督做上帝的事，他們也將自己等同於上帝。通過告訴其他人他們可以像基督 (上帝) 一樣，他們不允許他們的聽眾聽到，救恩是來自接待獨生子，至高的上帝之子作為他們的救主，並奪去祂所應得的榮耀和敬拜。他們給人們施加了一種不可能高舉自己的負擔，但卻不能 (也不會) 執行他們所建議的。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">整個精神和心態是敵基督，那意思是，人取代基督，基督是上帝。</p>\n<p><strong>基督——上帝的大能，對於所有相信的人來說</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">威爾斯提出了這些核心問題：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">“耶穌稱自己為上帝的兒子，也稱自己為人子; 但是他很少強調祂是誰或者祂是什麼，而很多都是基於王國的教義&#8230;耶穌是上帝嗎？還是上帝創造了祂？他是否與上帝完全相同的還是與上帝分開的？…到了基督教時代的第四世紀，我們發現所有基督徒社區都被關於上帝本性非常艱苦和難以捉摸的論點而焦慮和激怒，因為在很大程度上疏忽了耶穌灌輸的慈善、服事和弟兄情誼的簡單教導。</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">威爾斯不知道或認出的是，基督的教導<strong><em>就是</em></strong>祂。你不能將祂與祂的教導分開，而且如果沒有祂住在你裡面，你就無法應驗祂的教導。耶穌說<strong><em>祂</em></strong>就是道路、真理和生命。祂沒有這樣對於祂的教導說。因此，除非你吸收了祂，否則你無法吸收和表現祂的教導。這就是為什麼祂說：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「我就是從天上降下來生命的糧；人若吃這糧，必永遠活着。我為世人的生命所賜下的糧就是我的肉…我實實在在地告訴你們，你們若不吃人子的肉，不喝人子的血，在你們裏面就沒有生命。」(約翰福音 6:51-53)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">生命是在祂裡面，而不是在我們，或在頁面上的文字。根據我們正在研究的信仰，效法基督，祂的出現和服事的重點，實際上是虛假宗教的方式。這是虛假的，因為它依賴於並由人類在理解、愛護、崇拜和弟兄情誼方面的努力所推動，而不是來自擁有上帝的生命所帶來的愛與智慧。如果人類能夠勝任這項工作，並且自己裡面有本事做這些事情，為什麼救主要被派來去救他呢？那些將敬虔的模仿的能力歸於人，並基於對這種能力的認識行使假定的屬靈權威的人，代表了將基督釘在十字架上的同樣的自以為是義的靈。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">人生來拒絕上帝，寧願聽從自己的忠告，這就是他原本需要救主的原因。 「自助」宗教拒絕救主 (儘管它怎麼說)，並且根據上帝的說法，因此對地球上的所有流血事件負責：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「先知、聖徒和地上一切被殺的人的血，都在這城裡找到了。」(啟示錄 18:24)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">除非你藉著主的親自啟示認識基督，並且祂藉著祂的靈住在你裡面，否則你不能在上帝的事上有益於上帝或人類。只有擁有祂的本性，行在祂的大能之中，一個才會做上帝的事。那些將是真實的，而不是模仿作為。明白，因為我們生活在充滿假信仰的世界並不意味著沒有真實。因此，當祂顯現時，真正的顯而易見。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">真正的上帝信徒懂得基督是上帝，因為祂使他們能夠捨棄他們必須的一切以便與祂同行。人做不到的，在上帝通過基督凡事都能。通過基督，你可以從罪中得救，在上帝的旨意裡行走。如果你真的對祂有所了解，並認真地想效法祂，你很快就會發現自己是無助的。在基督向你顯現之前，你和萊克奇一樣認為能像上帝一樣可以決定是非，並且可以憑自己的能力選擇正確的。這就是一個人可以被欺騙的方式，儘管在他錯誤和不對之中如此真誠地說話。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">當我說你必須懂得基督是全能的上帝時，我顯然不是在談論知識上，教義上的認識。我說的是體驗上的認識。這種認識來自於信心，這是恩賜，並不是你可以通過模仿或任何其它方式獲得的。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">如果你有這種信心並相信 — 意思是在你所有的一切和作方你完全依賴上帝，通過主耶穌基督 — 你就不會在你的罪中滅亡。基督會拯救你。(事實上，你有信心是祂救恩的象徵正在進行中。) 你將學會靈與肉體，生與死，光明與黑暗，上帝的公義與自以為義之間的區別。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">直到你重生，你在內只有黑暗。當真光開始照耀你的心時，你就會憑信心知道你是誰以及你是什麼，因為在基督之光中你會看到。這就是為什麼我們被派遣去傳講祂，那個所有人的光，不是對祂的模仿，或任何其他事物，儘管我們建立並堅持祂的律法，作為祂真正的本質和本性的反映。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">上帝的律法，哪威爾斯所指的耶穌的道德和教義的基礎，在基督裡顯明出來，並揭示了人的罪惡：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">西門‧彼得看見，就俯伏在耶穌膝前，說：「主啊，離開我，我是個罪人。」(路加福音 5:8)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">當基督顯現上帝律法的完美時，律法就表明人對祂的需要，該救主，在其中行走。祂揭示了問題和解決方案。是上帝睜開人的眼睛看，使耳朵聽見。只有祂能讓人領悟去悔改並學會按照自己應當的方式行走。</p>\n<p><strong>上帝取人形</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">萊克奇寫道，客西馬尼 (主為祂即將被釘十字架而痛苦的花園) 說明了基督的人性：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">“他不是假裝成一個人的上帝; 而是亞伯拉罕的一個兒子，他正準備為每個人面臨死亡。”</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">誰說神在派獨生子降世時，因為祂取了有血有肉的人形，故作人？祂曾是個人。但祂只曾是亞伯拉罕的兒子嗎？祂不僅僅曾是一個人，正如耶穌對亞伯拉罕的後裔說：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「人們怎麼說基督是大衛的後裔呢？詩篇上大衛自己說：「主對我主說：『祢坐在我的右邊，等我使祢的仇敵作祢的腳凳。』大衛既稱祂為主，祂怎麼又是大衛的後裔呢？」(路加福音 20:41-44)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">彌賽亞並沒有假裝是一個人。祂在十字架上流了真血。流血的是上帝的兒子，這一事實使它更加強大。誰會對此爭端？這裡唯一假裝的是人們認為他們有基督的能力來行使聖潔的，而實際上他們並沒有。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">除了沒有罪，上帝在各方面都成了一個人。這使祂 — 耶穌基督 — 獨一無二，從來沒有，或曾經有這樣一個人。只有沒有罪的唯一的那個被發現配得打開生命冊：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">因為<strong>沒有人配展開觀看書卷</strong>，我就大哭。長老中有一位對我說：「不要哭。看哪，猶大支派中的獅子，大衛的根，祂已得勝，能展開那書卷，揭開那七個印。」(啟示錄 5:4-5)</p>\n<p>在祂肉身的日子裡，關於耶穌有說過：</p>\n<p>「從來沒有人像祂這樣說話的！」(約翰福音 7:46)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">既然我們知道上帝是一個無所不能的靈，而不是一個人。然而，這並不排除無所不能的靈，上帝，成為一個人。有什麼人可以否認上帝擁有這種大能，有什麼人可以證明祂不會也沒有行使它？他們會稱聖經不真實。首先，閱讀創世記的第十八章。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">萊克奇回想起，施洗約翰的父親預言約翰將成為至高者的先知，在主還沒有來之前為祂的來臨預備道路。為什麼萊克奇要引起我們的注意尚不清楚，因為他沒有把它當回事，但這是否意味著我們應該忽略那裡明顯所說的內容？約翰向以色列到底介紹了誰？</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「孩子啊，你要稱為至高者的先知，因為你要行在主的面前，預備祂的路，使祂的子民，因罪得赦，就知道救恩。因我們神的憐憫，使清晨的陽光從高天臨到我們，光照那坐在黑暗中死蔭裡的人，引導我們的腳，走上平安的路。」(路加福音 1:76-79)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">從什麼時候開始有什麼人被稱為「至高者」？如果不是全能的上帝，誰是至高者？有誰比祂升為至高？誰能拯救我們脫離罪惡？猶太人知道答案，他們被上帝教導過：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">文士和法利賽人就開始議論說：「這個人是誰，竟說褻瀆的話？除了神一位之外，誰能赦罪呢？」(路加福音 5:21)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">而且，誰是那個清晨的日光從高天臨到，給人帶來光明，如果不是上帝的話？</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「<strong>神是光，在祂裡面毫無黑暗</strong>；這就是我們從祂那裡聽見，現在傳給你們的信息。」(約翰一書 1:5)</p>\n<p>約翰福音 1:6-10<br />\n(6) 有一個人，是從神那裏差來的，名叫約翰。<br />\n(7) 這人來是為了作見證，是為那光作見證，要使眾人藉着祂而信。<br />\n(8) 他不是那光，而是要為那光作見證。<br />\n(9) 那光是真光，來到世上，照亮所有的人。<br />\n(10) 祂在世界，世界是藉着祂造的，世界卻不認識祂。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">換句話說，上帝，祂是光，成為肉體，一個人稱為耶穌基督。約翰稱基督為光。他也這樣說關於祂：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「但如果我們在光明[基督]中行走，就像神在光明[基督]中那樣，我們就是彼此相契合的；而且神的兒子耶穌的血也潔淨我們脫離一切的罪。」(約翰一書 1:7)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌基督是上帝為人類帶來光明和生命，使人成為祂的形象的方式。相像的生了相像的。只有上帝才能生出上帝的子女。這就是為什麼祂成為一個人，為人在祂自己裡面建造一個居所，並為祂自己在人身上建造一個居所。祂與人類認同，從而提供了方式，為人類從上而生並與祂認同。</p>\n<p><strong>基督暴露人的被污染教義</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">萊克奇說耶穌是上帝的兒子而不是聖子上帝是正確的。至少他不是三位一體論者所說的後者，他們使用這種描述將祂指定為另一個位格，與上帝分明。耶穌是上帝的兒子，因為上帝設想出祂自己以人的形式，祂的本質受時間和空間在有血有肉的身體限定，與任何人一樣，而祂，靈之父，一如既往地統治著所有領域。基督不是聖子上帝，因為仍然只有一位神，儘管祂在我們的維度中直接和獨立地將祂自己表現為一個人。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">同樣的，有上帝的靈，祂也被稱為基督的靈 (彼得前書1:11和羅馬書8:9)，但沒有聖靈上帝或聖靈基督。如果是這樣的話，那麼實際上會有四個神明而不是三個神明，一個「四位一體。」但是多神明的整個概念都是混亂和胡說八道。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">上帝怎能不止在一個領域中顯現？同樣的方式，祂可由祂的靈的大能，在不需要男人的情況在一個童女孕育了祂自己。祂的統治和存在遍及所有領域，有形和無形的。否認祂大能的表達就是否認上帝積極參與並且統治著我們世界的一切事物。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">通過童女分娩，上帝進入了我們的存在範圍，作為我們之中的一個。雖然祂是上帝(靈)，但祂仍然按照父(靈) 的旨意，過著人子(有血有肉) 的生活。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">這就是為什麼耶穌向上帝祈禱，並稱祂為父。祂被限制在一個身體和人人所傾向的弱點，作為有血有肉，依靠上帝來克服它們，就像我們一樣。作為上帝(靈)，祂能夠做任何人都做不到的事，就是在祂肉體的軟弱上完全依靠父。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">對於認為在天上和地上同時發現上帝是父與子這一看似矛盾的人來說，這是一個不可逾越的，考慮一下你自己立場的一些矛盾之處，哪表明你邏輯論據的弱點反對這個真理。早些時候我引用了耶穌告訴腓力說，那些見過祂的人已經見過父。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">問題：如果子不是父，那麼耶穌怎麼能說他們見過子已經是見過父了？那麼看見父還會有什麼意義呢？還是上帝所生的人將永不看到自己的父？</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌說祂在父裡面，父也在祂裡面。祂還說：「我所做的事，信我的人也要做，而且要做比這些更大的事。<strong>這是因為我就要到父那裡去了</strong>。」(約翰福音 14:12)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">問題：如果像祂說的那樣，『你們當相信我，我在父裡面，父也在我裡面』，祂怎麼要到父那裡去？祂不已經在那裡了嗎？</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">問題：如果作為三位一體教義的支持者，子與父同等，耶穌怎麼說，『我對你們說的話，不是憑自己說的，而是住在我裡面的父，在做祂的工作。』或者祂怎麼說，『這是因為父比我更大』(約翰福音 14:28)？</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">你可能會問我們其中一些問題，因為這些陳述似乎表明不止一個位格，因此與我們所說的相矛盾，但考慮它們也與你所說的相矛盾。那麼，你怎麼能如此肯定你的立場呢？</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">我們說，我們認識父，因為我們認識子，我們認識子，因為我們認識父，我們知道祂是一個的。「以色列啊，你要聽！主 — 我們的神是獨一的主。」</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">你了解這個真理，對我們來說重要嗎？不，對我們來說重要的是，主在子裡得到榮耀，而我們是。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">在放棄祂的旨意作為一個人，耶穌鋪平了讓我們做同樣事情的道路 — 在祂裡面捨棄我們的生命，這對我們的得救是可取的和必要的。我們自己無法做到這一點，受罪的阻礙和我們自己的自私和肉慾所俘虜的，直到上帝(基督)進入我們的境界並且讓我們通過祂克服了。在基督裡，上帝的誡命和應許同時應驗 — 我們滿足上帝的律法，克服罪惡和肉體，上帝在我們裡面實現祂的命運。榮耀哈利路亞！</p>\n<p>祂榮耀的命運是：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">第七位天使吹號，天上就有大聲音說：「世上的國已成了我們的主和祂所立的基督的國了。祂要作王直到永永遠遠！」(啟示錄 11:15)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">上帝必使所有的人都認識並事奉祂，從帶來死亡的罪惡的敗壞中得釋放，以便行走在祂的義之中，這就是生命。「<strong><em>祂</em></strong>要作王，」而不是「祂們，」因為沒有兩個主，而是一個主神，祂的王國必充滿全地。我們的主掌管是因為祂的基督戰勝了罪，不是為了祂自己，而是為了我們和在我們裡面。當這種得勝藉著祂的信心和我們在那信心中的順從而成為我們的得勝時，我們就會通過祂的基督的確體驗世界的王國成為上帝的。讚美神！祂在一個人做到的，祂會在每一個人都做。</p>\n<p><strong>創始者的工作就是祂的生活</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">萊克奇提出的一個很好的觀點是，在希伯來書第十一章的信心的偉人名單上沒有提到耶穌。當然，作為我們的「完美榜樣，」祂應該在鼓舞人心的見證名單名列前茅。但祂不在那裡。為什麼？答案是因為耶穌不是我們信心的榜樣; 祂是我們信心的創始成終者。唯一的那個賜給我們信心並在其中完善我們，祂不僅僅是一個榜樣或模範。 萊克奇聽從阿爾伯特·巴恩斯的聖經評論對這節經文的解釋，這是錯誤的：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">“[我們信心的創始者和成終者的]意思是，他是第一個也是最後一個作為信仰或相信上帝的例子 — 在這方面，就像在所有其它方面一樣，佔據主導地位，並且是可以擺在我們面前的最完整的模範。”</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">許多宗教將耶穌基督作為一個榜樣，或聲稱他們如此跟從祂，並沒有達到祂的榜樣，有嗎？恰恰相反。數以百萬計的人聲稱他們正在跟從祂的榜樣，這令他們到達哪裡和這個世界？衝突、混亂、虛偽、疾病、災難、冷漠、叛亂、對破壞者的支持、對調解人的迫害、猖獗的貪婪和被虛假虔誠所隱藏的慾望，這樣的例子不勝枚舉，並這一切都可以排列在那些告訴別人他們應該效仿耶穌的人的腳下。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">不，耶穌基督並沒有來以祂作為完美榜樣去跟從並將這負擔放在別人身上。祂說：「跟從<strong><em>我</em></strong>，」不是，「跟從<strong><em>我的榜樣</em></strong>。」祂對祂的使徒們說：「餵我的羊，」不是，「告訴他們用你給他們的知識來解決這個問題，這樣他們就可以自己做。」祂的羊是用什麼餵的？祂。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">跟從基督就是要與活生生的上帝建立關係，由祂的臨在帶領在其中祂設想出的，藉著祂的靈，一個人的新本性，成長為祂的樣式。在跟從一個榜樣是人在他對上帝的觀念中引導自己，其中各人都行自己看為對的事。這樣做的人雖然常常學習，總不能充分明白真理。耶穌基督是真理。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">萊克奇稱他的人造模範為「耶穌基督，」但不是<strong><em>真正主</em></strong>耶穌基督。這是一個以自己形象造的死人。總有一天，所有跟從這種方式的人都會聽到不同於他們假定複製的那一位的聲音：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「你做了這些事，我閉口不言，你以為我和你一樣；其實我要責備你，將這些事擺在你眼前。」(詩篇 50:21)</p>\n<p><strong>創始者的工作是我們的生活</strong></p>\n<p>巴恩斯繼續說：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">“「信心的開始者」或信仰的領導者這句話將表達這一想法。他是所有樹立對上帝信心的榜樣的人的首頭，因為他本身就是最傑出的例子。因此，這種表達並不意味著他對我們產生了信心，或者我們相信因為他使我們相信 — 不管真相如何 — 但他是最傑出的榜樣，在信仰問題上可以被提及。”</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">如果巴恩斯不能說出這些事情的真相，他為什麼還要費心用他的評論來浪費大家的時間？但我們知道真相，並且毫無歉意地說出來；簡直就是這樣。「信心的開始者」不是基督是一個傑出榜樣的問題，而因為祂是卓越的，作為信心的啟動者，唯一的那位召喚並揀選我們，使我們立志又實行祂的美意：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「不是你們揀選了我，而是我揀選了你們，並指派了你們，好使你們去，讓你們結出果子，而且使你們的果子長存。這樣，你們奉我的名無論向父求什麼，祂就會賜給你們。」(約翰福音 15:16)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">如果你自稱相信但沒有經歷這些事，你還沒有進入祂的信心。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:

justify;\">「既然知道人稱義不是靠行律法，<strong>而是藉著耶穌基督的信心</strong>，即使我們也就信了基督耶穌，<strong>使我們因基督的信心稱義</strong>，不是靠行律法；因為沒有人能靠行律法稱義。」(加拉太書 2:16)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">巴恩斯錯誤地說「信心的開始者」並不意味著基督在那些相信的人中產生了上帝的信心。情況正是如此：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「但聖經把萬物都圈在罪裏，以便耶穌基督的信心的應許歸給那些相信的人。」(加拉太書 3:22)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「你們得救確實是藉著恩典、藉著信，這不是出於你們自己，而是神的恩賜。」(以弗所書 2:8)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌對他說：「我就是道路、真理、生命；<strong>若不藉着我，沒有人能到父那裏去</strong>。」(約翰福音 14:6)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">巴恩斯是眾多靠自己努力的「基督徒」中的一個，他沒有從上帝那裡得到信心的恩賜，通過基督，而是製造了一個宗教信仰，在那裡知識、哲學和人類信仰取代了真實的東西。對他來說，基督的十字架是一個歷史事件，一個奉在墓碑上的教義，而不是一個活生生的現實，對於那些也參與了這個世界上丟臉的公開死亡，通過與基督背起十字架的人。證明我的觀點，巴恩斯說：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">“我們現在很難意識到表達的力量，『忍受了十字架的羞辱，』和在救主和使徒時代所理解的一樣。世界觀已經改變了&#8230;”</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:

你們述說吧！提出理由吧！讓他們彼此商議吧！誰從古時使人聽見這事呢？誰從上古把這事述說出來呢？不是我主嗎？<strong>除了我以外，再沒有神，我是公義的神，又是拯救者；除了我以外，並沒有別的神。</strong><br />\n(22) 全地的人哪！你們都要歸向我，都要得救。因為我是神，再沒有別的　神。<br />\n(23)

justify;\">「你們若是失明的，就沒有罪了；但現在你們說『我們能看見』，你們的罪還在。」(約翰福音 9:41)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">經上從未有寫過或暗示過基督是我們應該 (或可能) 模仿以實現敬虔的模式。先知和使徒或主自己沒有這樣的指示。我們被告知要服從祂，但不要試圖效仿祂。這兩者之間存在著天壤之別。當你去上班時，你不會效仿你的老闆所做的一切——如果你這樣試圖，你會被解僱——但你會按照你的職務描述和老闆吩咐你的去做。在軍隊中也是如此，與作為一個基督信徒相比 (提摩太後書 2:3-4)。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌基督是<strong><em>主</em></strong>，哪比榜樣更偉大、更不同。那些祂揀選的人被祂帶領就像羊被牧羊人帶領一樣。在跟從祂時，祂改變我們 (那些被祂召喚的人)，不是因為我們效法祂，而是因為祂是主，祂知道正在對我們做什麼，因為祂使我們符合祂的形象，在特別適合我們需要的情況下。我們的命運完全掌握在祂的手中，而不是我們自己的手中。那些跟從榜樣的人坐在駕駛座上，指導自己。他們與主耶穌基督無關。你可以肯定，除非你聽到祂的聲音並跟從祂，否則你不是祂的一隻羊。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞當斯在說有血有肉的<strong><em>可以</em></strong>繼承神的國度。事實上，他聲稱已經在那裡，憑藉他與基督(在他看來，僅僅是一個人) 平等的「事實」(這是謊言)。這就是這些人希望聽到的，那是耶穌來鼓勵他們的行為，上帝使用基督來證明未重生的人是與祂同等的，並完成任務。這絕對是不真實和敵基督的。如果在肉體的人與基督同等，那麼他就與上帝同等的，這種靈和心態給人類帶來了無盡的苦難。這就是為什麼你要知道這是一個謊言對你來說是如此重要，並且讓你知道真理，耶穌基督，全能的上帝和你的救主。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">上帝宣稱祂是陶匠，而人是泥土。陶土是否會靠本身成為一個形成它的複製品嗎？還是那個形成它的照祂的旨意使它成為這樣？這就是真正的宗教與虛假宗教，真正的基督徒和虛假的之間的區別。真正和確實的是由上帝造成的; 虛假是人造的，不是真實的。前者聽見並認識主權創造者，跟從祂，因為他已成為祂心甘情願的臣民；後者不聽祂，而拒絕祂，為的是隨心所欲地成為和塑造自己，不知道上帝是在使他成為恥辱的器皿。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">當聖經說到效法主的榜樣時，這是在對那些已經轉離罪惡的人說話，那些有基督的信心並聽見祂聲音的人。他們沒有勸勉那些沒有從罪惡中轉身的人要像上帝一樣通過效仿。只有那些歸向祂並在祂的靈裡受洗的人才能像祂，因為基督住在裡面，他們有祂的能力選擇隨從祂的靈而不是隨從肉體。這種選擇只存在於那些已經重生，在基督裡復活的人。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">例如，彼得對那些有基督的信心的人說，當他們因行祂的公義而遭受逼迫時，他們也應該效法祂留下受苦害而忍耐的榜樣。逼迫的起因和忍耐苦難都是基督的靈在人身上的工作，並不是人在他的自然屬肉體狀態下可以發起或執行的事情。耶穌基督是上帝在人身上運行祂的救恩，使他成為上帝的形象 (基督)。模仿的基督教是人代替上帝工作以滿足他肉體的慾望，不管他的心意是要擁有還是要保持。它可以非常具有欺騙性的，因為它被包裝在人公義上看似美麗而閃亮的外貌。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">保羅告訴信徒應該效法他，好像他效法基督一樣。在這，他也特別與那些在基督的人說話，他們擁有上帝的本質作為他們的繼承和走在其中的義務。這並不是擁有獨立於基督的能力來變得像祂的事情，而是擁有權力和能力去跟從祂因為祂在他們裡面，並且他們是祂身體的一部分。保羅的話不是為那些沒有領受上帝的靈，不是祂身體的一部分的人說的。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「如果神的靈住在你們裏面，你們就不屬肉體，而是屬靈了。人若沒有基督的靈，就不是屬基督的。」(羅馬書 8:9)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">我們到處看到沒有領受基督的靈的人，然而，他們假設，並且被教導去假設，他們擁有這輩子所希望的一切，根據經文和上帝的應許。有些人，如亞當斯和萊克奇，都說以耶穌基督為榜樣，儘管其中很少有真正試著像祂一樣。大多數人都說「<a

justify;\">這樣，他們就可以有藉口免於背起十字架和死去。他們拒絕在此時此地在基督裡過公義和無罪的生活。這些是現今的法利賽人，他們藉著信的人抵擋主在肉身的來到。他們的理解是在屬血氣的境界裡，其中沒有人能認識基督或擁有上帝的事物。肉體是永遠與上帝為敵。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌說除了上帝啟示他的人之外，沒有人知道子是誰。這不是告訴你基督不是屬血氣的人，而是上帝祂自己嗎？否則，作為人類，我們可以認識祂作為另一個人：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「除了在人裡面的靈，誰能知道人的事呢？同樣，除了神的靈，也沒有人知道神的事。」(哥林多前書 2:11)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:

style=\"text-align: justify;\">人確實需要救主，只有唯一的那個聖潔與罪人分開才能勝任。那些在罪惡和死亡中的人需要唯一的那個不是，祂拿著死亡和陰間的鑰匙。否則，他們怎麼能稱祂為救主呢？救主又怎能不無所不能，將人從罪惡和死亡中拯救出來呢？</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">如果人有能力通過效法耶穌基督使自己從死裡復活，就不需要救主，聖經宣稱有救主是錯誤的。那些宣揚基督為榜樣的人，被他們聲稱相信的聖經所記載的內容所困惑。聖經的總體觀點是，你需要得救，並且無法拯救自己。沒有什麼靠自己的努力取得成功的事。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">萊克奇說他不需要被拉起來，無論如何謝謝你。他已經很好了，配備了他極其鼓舞人心的榜樣，恰好和他一樣，另一個扮演英雄的男人; 現在肯尼斯可以成為英雄，帶給你他所製成的偶像的知識，其知識將「拯救」你。這就是聖經所說的人的行為，哪上帝所譴責是你必須完全避開的事情，如果你想看到生命。這些是耶穌警告過的假基督。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">這是一個謎題：一個人怎麼能聲稱自己如此軟弱無能，卻想靠自己的努力達到天堂？上帝對這個人說：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">你心裏曾說：『我要升到天上，我要高舉我的寶座在神的眾星之上，我要坐在會眾聚集的山上，在極北的地方。我要升到高雲之上，我要與至高者同等。』(以賽亞書 14:13-14)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">如果萊克奇知道上帝的恩典和祂的大能，他就不會以缺乏和如此悲慘的境遇作為他有罪的藉口。他會懂得，靠著那加強他居住在他裡面的基督，凡事都能做。他不會妄稱主的名，哪是他在他的表白所作所為，而是有一個積極的認罪，結出榮耀上帝的果子。加強一個人的不是基督扮作榜樣，而是祂實際的存在。當祂與你同在時，祂的血洗淨你一切的罪惡，而祂的靈是在患難中隨時都可得到的幫助。這個現實對那些自己動手的人來說只是一個童話。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">一個效法榜樣的人是在做事，結果與他的能力相稱; 而一個敬拜基督的人，神住在他裡面，結果與祂的權力和能力相稱。我們 (那些在基督裡的) 不是無助的足球，在邪惡勢力之下。根本算不上：</p>\n<p>「因為我們作戰所用的兵器，不是屬於這世界的，而是屬神的能力，可以攻陷堅固的堡壘，拆毀所有為抵擋神的知識而樹立起來的高牆；又虜獲各樣的心意，達到屬基督的順從。」(哥林多後書 10:4-5)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">我來到耶穌基督面前不是因為我可以拯救自己，而是因為我不能。我自己也不知道這一點，但上帝不得不把我放在一邊，向我揭示我的狀況。沒有啟示，我們誰也不知道我們的真實身份。我們在黑暗中，什麼也看不見。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">我們都認為我們是如此強大，能夠選擇正確和行善，因為我們還沒有在光裡，那裡我們可以看到我們的主和標準，相比之下，我們完全敗壞。當我們看到祂，耶穌基督，上帝在肉身顯現，我們厭惡自己，並在塵土和灰燼中悔改。我們不敢認為我們可以像祂; 事實上，我們會像死人一樣俯伏在祂的腳前。(上帝已經說過，沒有人可以看見了祂並還能活著，祂每一句話都是真的。) 在這個巨大的變化之後，自由、權力和生命 — 在祂裡面 — 都在到了時候。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">使徒保羅說他是罪人中的首惡，因為他迫害了主耶穌，殺了祂的聖徒。保羅轉變了，當主耶穌基督在去大馬士革的路上遇見了他，他從驢身摔下來，瞎了眼的時候。他同時稱耶穌為「主」，儘管他不知道祂的名字。保羅沒有通過肉眼或自然感官看到基督，當然也沒有將祂視為自己的榜樣。信心的恩賜不是模仿而來的，所以保羅沒有這樣做。他沒有說，「主啊，我現在看到你是一個人，之後我可以自我模仿，這啟發了我！」恰恰相反，他教導人們：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「所以，從今以後，我們不再按肉體認識人；雖然我們曾經按肉體認識基督，但現在不再這樣了。如果有人在基督裡，他就是新造的人，舊事已經過去，你看，都變成新的了。」(哥林多後書 5:16-17)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">保羅承認耶穌為主後，主吩咐一個名叫亞拿尼亞的人按手在他身上，使他能恢復視力，並領受上帝的靈。亞拿尼亞沒有說要效法耶穌作為榜樣。你可以可以隨心所欲製作你喜歡的榜樣，挑選，選擇和按照你的意願行事，因為你負責管理; 然而，對於聖徒，基督親自在那裡，按照祂的旨意說話和帶領他們！</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">祂並不是遙遠或遠離保羅和亞拿尼亞的，一個他們重現或想像出來的圖像，而是在場的，指導他們並使需要發生的事情發生。只有上帝才能這樣命令，否則祂的名字和頭銜就是毫無意義的謊言。亞當斯和萊克奇正在傳講另一個基督，不是經上所記載的那個基督，祂被證明是上帝而不是騙子。因為他們說他們的基督不是全能的，他們真實地說話。他們的神明是謊言，是一個工作 (人的行為)，而不是恩典 (上帝的工作)。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞當斯說：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">&#8230;作為墮落人類的一員，我最想知道的不是基督離神有多近，而是他離人有多近。我當然想知道他能不能達到上帝，但我更想知道他能不能下達到我; 簡而言之，我想知道他是不是人，「一個弟兄為患難而生的，」一個嬰孩以及一個兒子賜給&#8230;.</span>”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:

style=\"text-align: justify;\">希伯來書 4:14-16</p>\n<p>(14) 既然我們有一位偉大、進入高天的大祭司，就是耶穌 — 神的兒子，我們應當持定所宣認的道。<br />\n(15) 因為我們的大祭司並非不能體恤我們的軟弱；祂也在各方面受過試探，與我們一樣，只是祂沒有犯罪。<br />\n(16) 所以，我們只管坦然無懼地來到施恩的寶座前，為要得憐憫，蒙恩惠，作及時的幫助。</p>\n<p>耶穌基督下達的不是那些對自己和罪還活著的人，而是那些已經轉離罪惡並通過十字架來到祂施恩寶座前的人。上帝拯救我們那些相信通過耶穌基督，祂知道我們的弱點，但已經克服了它們，並坐在上帝的寶座上。現在，那些不相信，並選擇認同墮落的亞當而不是復活的唯一的那個，他們會發現在世俗的人身上找不到救恩的艱難道路。我們駁斥這個教導，因為我們認識基督，上帝我們的救主，祂已將我們從不信和罪惡的領域中解放出來，與祂坐在祂在天上的寶座上。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">我們得知基督是誰，就像耶穌給那瞎子看見一樣。起初我們不知道祂是誰，只知道祂打開我們的眼睛看見上帝，我們因祂在我們身上所行的信心奇蹟而相信了祂。祂告訴我們真理，我們相信並敬拜祂：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌聽說他們把他趕出去了，後來找到他，說：「你信人子嗎？」他回答說：「主啊，人子是誰呢？好讓我信祂。」耶穌說：「你已經看到祂了，現在與你說話的，就是那一位。」他說：「主啊，我信！」就向耶穌下拜。(約翰福音 9:35-38)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">萊克奇和亞當斯正試圖將基督降到他們的級別，而不是對於自己死去，並靠著和在祂裡面復活。亞當斯並不想知道基督是否能夠下達並拯救他; 他只想知道自己是否能夠在不付出代價的情況下達到基督的地位。那是不可能的：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「這樣，你們中間不論誰，如果不撇下一切所有的，就不能作我的門徒。」(路加福音 14:33)</p>\n<p><strong>神的軟弱比人更強壯</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞瑟·亞當斯繼續說：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">現在為了凡事像他的弟兄一樣，他開始了他的塵世生活，低於亞當。後者被創造為一個上帝的兒子，一個成年人，具有無罪的本性。基督開始了他的生活，一個無助的嬰兒，墮落人類的兒子和上帝的兒子，具有罪惡的本性。</span>”</p>\n<p>如果亞當有無罪的本性，他如何犯罪？</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「凡從神生的，不犯罪，因神的種子存在他裏面，他也不能犯罪，因為他是由神所生的。」(約翰一書 3:9)</p>\n<p>如果基督有罪的本性，祂怎麼不犯罪？</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「因我們的大祭司並非不能體恤我們的軟弱，祂也曾凡事受過試探，與我們一樣，只是祂沒有犯罪。」(希伯來書 4:15)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">萊克奇和亞當斯將事情倒退了。他們敬拜第一個人亞當，而基督，末後的亞當，是值得崇拜的，因為祂是以肉身而來的神。基督沒有犯罪，因為神沒有罪性。這就是末後亞當所生的人不犯罪的原因；他們繼承了祂的本性。沒有人能夠克服第一個人亞當的本性。只有基督，上帝無罪的兒子，並且在那些相信的人身上也是如此。這就是為什麼經上有記載，基督若在你裏面，身體就因罪而死，靈卻因義而活 (羅馬書8:10)。沒有神在你裡面，你就無法克服罪，那就是基督。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">所以，一方面，我們有主耶穌基督，祂不能犯罪，因為祂沒有罪性; 而另一方面，我們有這兩個人以及其他許多人，他們生活在第一個人亞當的罪性中，認為已經找到了一種方法可以留在其中，而不必為這樣做的後果承擔責任。他們在上帝面前取得了基督的有利地位，好像這是他們的天然繼承，沒有付出進入的代價， 就是他們的生命。他們從別處爬進去的。罪惡和生活在墮落人裡的後果必須並將繼續累積在他們身上，直到他們不再是自己的神明為止。</p>\n<p><strong>神在基督裡的無罪完美是我們的救恩</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞當斯繼續說：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">有些人可能會反對基督有罪性的說法; 但這肯定是聖經的積極教導。他「成為有罪的;」(哥林多後書第二十一節) 他不是一個罪人，相反他「不知道罪，」他是聖潔的，不會傷人的，沒有被玷污的; 那他怎麼成為有罪的？通過承擔人類墮落的本性，沒有其它方式可以使他成為有罪的; 他是「由女人所生」這一事實進一步證實了這一點；「誰能使潔淨出於污穢呢？無人有此本事」(約伯記 14:4)。</span>”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">這是雙重談話和混亂。如果基督作為一個不能犯罪的人活著，那麼祂就沒有墮落的本性。你不能兩者兼得。墮落的本性是那個使人成為罪人——犯罪的人。唯一可能的結論是，基督成為有罪的並不意味著祂有罪的本性。我可以根據聖經告訴你這是怎麼回事。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">神所要的祭在摩西律法所吩咐的是必須毫無瑕疵。他們是「沒有罪，」但牠們因充當人類的贖罪祭而變成有罪的。這些祭預示了將要來到的完美的那個，祂將會成為有罪的 (即使正這個詞「成為有罪的」告訴你祂不是有罪的本性）並且，藉著祂獻祭，將一勞永逸地消除我們的罪惡。任何不完美的東西都無法為我們贖罪，讓我們變得完美。罪惡的本性並不完美。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌基督成了有罪和詛咒，不是因為祂有缺陷，而是因為祂不是，為了那些有缺陷的人而受苦，要除去我們的罪，把我們帶入在祂裡面的神的完美。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌是不潔淨嗎，因為祂從一個女人來，一個墮落的人類？不，對於祂來說，「由女人所生」並不意味著大衛王所說的意思：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「看哪，我是在罪孽裡生的；我母親在罪中懷了我。」(詩篇 51:5)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">全人類都從出身繼承了墮落亞當的本性。但耶穌基督是不同的。雖然是由一個女人所生的，但祂是由上帝孕育的，祂是沒有罪的。在這種情況下，較大的不會被較小的所超越，就像黑暗不能克服光一樣。在基督裡，所有人的光都克服了黑暗，並且仍然如此。耶穌可能會受試探，因為祂是一個人，但祂沒有犯罪，因為祂是上帝。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞當斯：“<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">此外他「像我們在各方面受過試探，」如果他沒有罪惡的本性，他怎麼會受過試探呢？</span>”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:

justify;\">從女人生的人和從神生的人的區別是，我們這些通過基督藉著祂的靈重生的人，在裡面擁有神無罪的本性，哪保持我們不再犯罪，使我們能夠學習順從。這就是為什麼祂被稱為救主。祂不僅赦免我們的罪，而且從裡面拯救我們通過將我們從罪惡的本性中解救出來，直到我們成長為祂的豐滿，那就是一個完美的人。為了什麼目的，上帝讓我們永遠需要不斷的赦免？但基督來是為了一勞永逸地除掉罪，祂有上帝的所有的能力這樣做。</p>\n<p

祂不僅有解藥，<strong>祂就是解藥</strong>。祂在肉身表現出上帝的更高本性，這是一種抗拒罪的本性，這就是我們需要祂的原因。正是通過這種本性，即生命本身，基督克服了死亡。對於祂，經上有記載：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「神卻解除了死亡的痛苦，使祂復活，<strong>因為祂原不能被死亡轄制</strong>。」(使徒行傳 2:24)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">如果死亡不可能拘禁耶穌，那麼我們不僅可以說上帝使祂復活，而且祂也使祂自己復活，因為<strong>耶穌基督是上帝的生命和大能在人裡面</strong>。聖經有這樣說嗎？是的，聖經是這樣記載：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌回答他們說：「你們拆毀這殿，<strong>我</strong>三天之內<strong>要把它建造起來</strong>。」(約翰福音 2:19)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:

8:58)</p>\n<p>約翰福音 3:34-36<br />\n(34) 神所差來的說神的話，因為神所賜給祂的靈是沒有限量的。<br />\n(35) 父愛子，把一切都交在祂手裡了。<br />\n(36) 信從子的人，就有永恆的生命；但是不肯信從子的人，見不到生命，而且神的震怒也停留在他身上。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:

style=\"text-align: justify;\">當耶穌說祂不能憑著「自己」做任何事時，祂指的是肉身。但正如我已經表明的那樣，祂不是在肉身裡。祂在靈裡，並且總是憑著靈而行：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「派我來的那一位與我同在；父沒有撇下我，使我獨自一人，因為我一直做祂所喜悅的事。」(約翰福音 8:29)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌就是這樣完成了這麼多偉大的工作，最終為世人捨命，三天後自己從墳墓中取回過來。你真的會稱之為「軟弱無力」嗎？</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">然而，亞當斯反對將任何功勞歸於基督：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">不，這些是上帝的工作；根本不是基督的作為，而是父神的作為。他賦予基督能力；基督單單通過上帝的大能完成了他偉大的工作。如果他願意，上帝可以賦予你或我能力做同樣的事情，而且有些人最終將擁有這種能力，甚至可以做比基督所做的更大的事情 (參見約翰福音 14:12)。</span>”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">是的，它們是上帝的工作，但通過祂的受膏使者耶穌基督。你不能把兩者分開。舊約中，上帝經常在被稱為祂的使者，即主的使者身上看到和聽到。例如：</p>\n<p>創世記 22:15-18<br />\n(15) 主的使者第二次從天上呼喚亞伯拉罕，<br />\n(16) 說：「主說：『你既行了這事，沒有留下你的兒子，就是你的獨子，我指着自己起誓：<br />\n(17) 我必多多賜福給你，我必使你的後裔大大增多，如同天上的星、海邊的沙。你的後裔必得仇敵的城門，<br />\n(18) 並且地上的萬國都必因你的後裔得福，因為你聽從了我的話。』」</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">在主的使者向瑪挪亞和他的妻子顯現並告訴他們祂將給他們兒子 (參孫) 之後，瑪挪亞對他的妻子說：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「我們一定會死，因為我們看見了神。」(士師記 13:22)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">上帝的使者以上帝的身份說話，祂自己的名義 (即是一)，因為祂是上帝。這是上帝對人說話和顯現祂自己的方式。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌之所以把祂所有的工作都歸於父神，是因為這些工作不是出於人的意志，也不是出於肉身，即祂的「自己，」這就是人們只看外表，看到和認可的。他們不認識站在他們面前做事 — 主他們的神。上帝曾經和現在都是通過耶穌基督顯現的。這就是為什麼耶穌也稱它們為祂的工作：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌對他們說：「你們去告訴那狐狸：看哪！<strong>今天明天我驅趕鬼魔、治癒疾病</strong>，然後在第三天，我的事就得以完成了。」(路加福音 13:32)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌就對他們說：「來跟從我！<strong>我將要使你們成為得人的漁夫</strong>。」(馬可福音 1:17)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">有一個痲瘋病人來到耶穌面前，跪下來懇求祂說：「如果祢肯，祢就能潔淨我。」耶穌動了憐憫之心，就伸出手來摸他，說：「<strong><em>我肯</em></strong>，你潔淨了吧！」痲瘋病立刻離開他，他就被潔淨了。(馬可福音 1:40-42)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">使徒們也這樣報告：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「那麼，你們大家和所有以色列子民應當知道：藉著拿撒勒人耶穌基督的名，這位耶穌基督，你們把祂釘上十字架，但是神使祂從死人中復活了，<strong>即使通過祂</strong>，這個人健全地站在你們面前。」(使徒行傳 4:10)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:

style=\"text-align: justify;\">上帝不僅僅賦予基督能力; <strong>上帝是基督，基督是上帝</strong>。耶穌以祂的父的名稱說話，因為祂作為一個人的形式，就像其他人一樣，在空間和時間上是有限的。以這種方式，祂代表了一個人應該與上帝建立的關係，並將擁有的，因為祂為我們開闢了道路讓我們擁有它。但這並不意味著上帝受到任何約束或限制，因為祂在祂的使者基督裡在地上行走。雖然祂是作為一個人來的，但是在一個人裡面，上帝並不局限於一個人的位置。這就是為什麼耶穌對稱祂為「良善的夫子」的人說：</p>\n<p>「你為甚麼稱我是善良的？除了神一位之外，再沒有善良的。」(路加福音 18:19)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">那個人像這些宗教哲學家一樣，在肉體上看待主，稱讚肉體好像它是好的，因為他們認為它們是好的。說這話的人不認為他是好的，說他遵守了上帝所有的誡命嗎？但耶穌不是在肉體上，因此不接受人們對祂肉體的讚美。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">在這一點上，祂遠超亞當斯所描繪的軟弱無助的人。祂倒空自己，使自己軟弱，取了奴僕的形像 (腓立比書2:7)，但通過這樣做，祂表明了祂的大能和威嚴。沒有一個比這更強大的存在，祂可以放棄所有的能力，因軟弱而被釘死在十字架上，然後將自己的身體從死裡復活。那是能力的終極展示，捨棄生命然後再取回來。在任何時候，任何地方都沒有任何什麼更強大的了。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">罪人的問題不在於他們是軟弱的，而在於他們自己是強大的。他們不需要上帝，因為他們對肉體有信心，他們自己知道善與惡的區別。他們一直在吃知識樹上的。這就是為什麼耶穌說如果不是上帝吸引人，就沒有能來到祂那裡，生命之樹。每個人都比祂知道得更好，所以他們不會來到祂面前。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">你不能與基督認同，事實上，你藐視祂，你掩面不看祂 (以賽亞書第五十三章)，直到將你變得軟弱，不再信賴自己為止。你必須成為一個小孩，缺乏知識的驕傲。直到你謙卑下來，你才會停止按自己的想法和方式生活，而開始按祂的方式生活。然後你會看到並認識祂，並將體驗祂的善良和能力。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">這就是<a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/chinese/the-cross-only-death-sentence-will-avail.htm\"><u>十字架</u></a>的意義所在，以及為什麼對它是如此急需的。在亞當斯對基督和上帝的所有譁眾取寵、哲學思考和推測中，十字架對他來說很陌生。亞當斯和萊克奇都自以爲了不起，以他們的知識為榮，與上帝和基督為完全仇敵，因此也是所有人的屬靈仇敵。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">認識上帝來自於背起十字架，經歷發火燄死亡之劍，通往到生命之樹，而不是神學，即吃知識之樹的成果。祂憎惡神學，因為這是推定，一心一意做自己的事情的結果，要像上帝一樣，即使夏娃受過試探這樣做，結果跌倒了，她的丈夫跟著她，給所有人帶來了死亡。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌基督是生命之樹，是死亡的解藥。我們怎麼知道呢？祂說要拿祂的身體來吃，這樣你就會有永生，並且會從死裡復活 (約翰福音 6:54)。祂說：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「因為我的肉是真正的食物，我的血是真正的飲物。吃我肉、喝我血的人，就住在我裡面，我也住在他裡面。正如永活的父差遣了我，我也因父活著；照樣，吃我肉的人也必因我而活。」(約翰福音 6:55-57)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">你不住在一個榜樣的裡面。一個榜樣不住在你裡面也不會給你生命。那些在另一個人身上尋找生命和寄託的人總是被毀滅的。只有上帝才能完成這樣的使命，無論你身在何處，都能與你同在，以祂的生命來支持你。如果你仰望耶穌基督並遵守祂的誡命，你就會在祂裡面找到生命，因為祂是活著的，並且會來到那些期待仰望祂的人。我們作見證這些話是真實的：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「信我的人，就如經上所說的，從他的腹中將要湧流出活水的江河。」(約翰福音 7:38)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">在祂作為一個人的日子裡，耶穌基督完全與上帝認同，與祂合而為一，在身體和意志的順服，這就是為什麼祂可以這樣說祂自己和祂的工作：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「我若不作我父的事，你們就不必信我；我若作了，你們縱然不信我，也應當信這些事，好使你們確實知道，我父是在我裡面，我也在父裡面。」(約翰福音 10:37-38)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">基督怎麼能與父如此親密地認同，以至於祂能夠公開大膽地做出這些聲稱並像祂一樣支持它們？從來沒有其他人那樣做的。因為耶穌和父是一。不僅父在基督裡，而且基督也在父裡，甚至在創世之前 (約翰福音17:5)。 萊克奇或亞當斯可以這樣說他們自己嗎？那麼，他們如何與他們聲稱的基督一樣呢？任何人都可以做出這些聲稱嗎？沒有; 但是耶穌這樣說了祂自己，並證明了這一點，因為祂是主我們的神。「以色列啊，你要聽！主 — 我們的神是獨一的主。」(申命記6:4)</p>\n<p><strong>只有在基督裡的人是從神而生的</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">宗教哲學家，因為他們不在基督裡，祂也不在他們裡面，所以不做祂的工作，尤其是耶穌告訴祂的門徒在祂回到父那裡之後他們會做更大的事。這些更大的事是什麼？還有什麼比使瞎眼的看見到或讓死人復活更大的事？耶穌在肉身的日子裡，只有一件事那時還未能做，那就是帶領祂的門徒進入新生，就是祂從神那裡得到的生命。只有在祂得到榮耀之後，上帝才能將祂的靈賜給住在那些相信祂的人裡面，賜給他們基督的生命和能力。在此之前，門徒雖然相信，但不能跟從主在哪裡。他們不在同一個地方，也缺乏像祂那樣做的能力，這是上帝在基督升天之前無法賜給他們的。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">雖然基督說祂被限定 (路加福音 12:50)，但我們看到是上帝限制祂自己，直到祂能從上面澆灌祂的靈。一個榜樣是不夠的。門徒在他們面前就有在肉身上帝的活生生的榜樣。有什麼更好的機會跟從基督？彼得非常認真地說，儘管其他人都會否認祂，但他會一直跟從基督到死。誰能懷疑他的誠意？但是耶穌告訴彼得和祂所有的門徒，他們會因祂發生的事情而被絆倒。耶穌知道聖經預言了這一點，因為祂是道 (神) 成肉身：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">那時，耶穌對他們說：「今天晚上，你們都將因我被絆倒，因為經上記著：『我將擊打牧人，群羊就被分散。』(馬太福音 26:31)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">在基督之前，沒有人是從<a href=\"https://www.thepathoftruth.com/chinese/holy-spirit-baptism_chinese.htm\"><u>靈生的</u></a>。施洗約翰是最大的先知，雖然在他出生之前就被上帝的靈充滿，但他宣稱他需要這個受基督的洗 (馬太福音 3:14)。沒有先知，或上帝的人，甚至摩西和以利亞以他們所有大的信心之工，都不是從上頭生的。這只有在基督復活和升天之後才有可能。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">為什麼新生，一個屬肉體的人不容易觀察或理解的事情，比紅海的分開或拉撒路從死裡復活要大得多 — 對我們的感官來說如此巨大而聳人聽聞的事件？因為新生是<strong>神在人裡面</strong>，而這些神蹟是<strong>上帝為人所做</strong>的事。儘管後者很美妙，但我們並沒有在其中領受上帝的生命。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">這就解釋了以色列人如何在目睹了上帝通過摩西之手在他們眼中所行的所有偉大神蹟之後，不相信並最終與其它神明混合。他們看到的神蹟沒有改變他們的能力。新生就有這種能力。彼得和其他門徒在五旬節領受上帝之靈後的變化證明了這一點。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">由於屬靈的大大超越了身體的，所以從上面的新生比地上任何身體的神蹟都要大得多。這是因基督的信心而轉變為像神一樣的方法，成為在天國與上帝的本性上有份。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">這最神奇的權力被賜給使徒，應驗了基督的話語，當他們按手在相信的人身上，使他們領受了上帝的靈。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">以下是上帝通過祂的身體所做的與亞當斯和萊克奇等人所宣揚的區別：人不能生殖神。他們可以非常虔誠，做許多偉大的工作，但只有上帝，藉著基督的靈在那些接待祂的人裡，才能在人類中生殖祂自己。這就是為什麼那些從祂生的被稱為<strong>祂的</strong>身體的原因。他們是永生上帝的子女，從世界及其屬世的、肉體的宗教工作中被召喚出來，比如我們在這裡回答的，這些人認為人類有責任去弄清楚上帝並試圖讓祂發生，就好像祂還不是主權的並且祂自己在做這一切的。</p>\n<p><strong>耶穌基督是上帝的大能</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞當斯：“<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">基督基本身上是一個軟弱無力的人; 他所作的是靠著上帝的能力，就像上帝可以賦予能力給任何人做一項大的工作一樣; 因此，例如，保羅說，「我比任何使徒更加勞苦做工；其實不是我，而是與我同在的神的恩典」(哥林多前書 15:10) ; 所以基督同樣的道理也可能說同樣的話&#8230;.</span>”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">保羅和基督之間的區別在於保羅必須從罪中轉向上帝 — 主耶穌基督 (「主啊，<strong><em>祢</em></strong>是誰？」)，而基督是上帝，沒有罪。祂一直與父同在，而父也一直與祂同在。在基督裡，上帝取了人的形像，作為一個人，祂學會了負起順從的軛意味著什麼。基督從來沒有不順從 (在罪中)，但祂必須為我們的緣故學會順從。祂將祂的身體獻給上帝，作為無瑕疵的供物 (希伯來書10:5-10)，這樣我們就可以與上帝和好並且也做同樣的事。祂從來不需要悔改，因為祂從來沒有犯罪。祂沒有<strong><em>領受</em></strong>上帝的恩典，不如說祂<strong><em>就是</em></strong>上帝的恩典，顯現在一個人，並且完全實現了：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「道成了肉身，居住在我們中間。我們看到了祂的榮耀，正是從父而來的獨生子的榮耀，充滿了恩典和真理。」(約翰福音 1:14)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞當斯和萊克奇試圖典當人們的想法是，上帝賦予能力給那些自稱相信基督的人，就好像他們是繩子上的牽線木偶一樣，這基本上免除了他們對自己所做的事情的任何責任。他們不僅被赦免，而且，通過這個概念，他們也被稱義，因為上帝掌管著一切，因此，他們一定在做祂想要的任何什麼。他們在肉體上被稱義和得榮耀。他們可以自由地模仿祂而不受懲罰，卻沒有意識到他們因此嘲笑祂而受懲罰。按照主的話，要救他們自己的生命，他們必喪失生命：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「因為凡要救自己生命的，必喪失生命；凡為我喪失生命的，他必救自己的生命。」(路加福音 9:24)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">事情的真相是，上帝的能力來自在基督裡的新本性，是由這個本性所居住的人所行使的。「先知的靈是順服先知的」(哥林多前書14:32)。我們不是木偶。是那個人做的，但是由上帝的能力使他做的，他必須利用它，就像毛毛蟲的本性，就是把繭變成蝴蝶。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">任何人都可以做信心之工也是不正確的，因為正如我們所表明的那樣，必須有新造的人通過新生，來彰顯基督的工作。這就是保羅可以這樣說，是上帝在他裡面的恩典，從上頭來的的新本性，他才能工作的 (哥林多前書15:10)，而不是肉體，這些人把功勞歸於肉體，榮耀並信賴自己的義。他們慘遭失敗，更糟糕的是他們卻不知道。光必須為他們照亮，讓所有人都能看到。我們就是那在基督裡的光：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「沒有甚麼掩蓋的事不被揭露，也沒有甚麼隱藏的事不被人知道。」(路加福音 12:2)</p>\n<p>亞當斯繼續說：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">「一切都是出於上帝的」：這對耶穌和對任何其他人都是如此。耶穌和任何其他人一樣，是真正的「神所作成的」(以弗所書 2:10)&#8230; 上帝是他的創造者、上帝和父，正如他是我們的創造者、上帝和父一樣。</span>”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">確實，耶穌過著的生活是每個信徒都被呼召這樣過活，一切都是出於上帝的。在這方面，祂的上帝是我們的上帝。然而，除了藉著基督並通過基督，沒有人能過那種生活，這也是事實，因為沒有其他人是，並且已經被稱為上帝的大能 (哥林多前書1:24)。沒有其他人是由童女生的。沒有其他人被稱為彌賽亞，<strong><em>該</em></strong>受膏者。沒有其他人有資格稱自己為世界之光、活水或從天上降下來生命的糧。舊約和新約的聖經，都作證沒有其他人是上帝的中心人物。萬有都是藉著祂造的，而沒有其他人 (歌羅西書1:16)。沒有其他人被稱為建造上帝房屋的人 (希伯來書3:3)。沒有其他人被稱為永在的父 (以賽亞書9:6)。沒有其他人能夠將自己的身體從死裡復活併升天。沒有其他人拿著死亡和陰間的鑰匙 (啟示錄 1:18)。所以，我們的情況完全不同，因為我們通過耶穌基督依賴上帝：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌說：「我就是道路、真理、生命。要不是藉著我，沒有人能到父那裡去。」(約翰福音 14:6)</p>\n<p>而祂不需要中保：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「因為神只有一位，在神和人中間也只有一位中保，就是降世為人的基督耶穌。」(提摩太前書 2:5)</p>\n<p><strong>既然人不能成為上帝，上帝就成了人</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞當斯說關於耶穌：“<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">他開始在同一層面上，並經歷了同樣的過程; 「因受苦難得以完全」— 那個墮落的人必須通過才能達到完美。他是如此徹底地成為人類，以至於他受到了詛咒（加拉太書3:13)，並且必須像其他人類一樣被救贖; 參見希伯來書 9:11,12。「但基督已經來了…他不是用山羊和牛犢的血，而是用自己的血，只一次進了至聖所，就得到了永遠的救贖。」</span>”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">我們已經討論了基督與所有其他人之間的差異，但我將進一步揭露耶穌必須從罪中贖回的主張虛假 (好像祂在詛咒之下)。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">根據上帝的律法，在詛咒之下的人需要山羊和牛犢作為贖罪祭。沒有這種祭品的血，即使是大祭司也無法進入至聖所，這表明通往至聖所的道路對任何人並不是開放的。但是耶穌基督一勞永逸地進入了天國裡的真正至聖所，沒有這些上帝所命定的事物或任何其他代求者的幫助：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「祂見無人，無人代求，就非常詫異，所以祂用自己的膀臂為祂施行拯救，以自己的公義扶持祂。」(以賽亞書 59:16)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">唯一能繞過上帝對人的禁令，滿足人需要的，就是上帝祂自己。主耶穌基督進入至聖所，不是為祂自己，而是為我們所有需要代求者來拯救和救贖的人：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「在祂裡面，我們藉著祂的血得到救贖，罪得赦免。祂是那看不見的神之像，是萬有之首。」(歌羅西書 1:14-15)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌基督並沒有為自己流血，因為沒有必要。祂說父一直與祂同在，因為祂一直做上帝所喜悅的事 (約翰福音 8:29)。父也為祂作證 (馬太福音3:17及17:5)。如果上帝一直喜悅並一直與祂同在，罪在哪裡？如果沒有罪，就不需要獻祭。流血是為了罪，按照聖經所說，沒有流血，就沒有赦罪。基督的血為你和我而流，不是為了祂自己：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「神愛世人，甚至將祂獨一的兒子賜給他們，叫一切信祂的人不致滅亡，反得永生。」(約翰福音 3:16)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「因為祂僅只一次獻祭，就使那些得以成聖的人永遠完全。」(希伯來書 10:14)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">祂不需要使自己成聖，但祂為了使我們分別為聖的而參與了人性：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「萬有因祂而有、萬有藉祂而成的那一位，既然要帶領許多兒女歸於榮耀，就藉著苦難使他們救恩的創始者得以成全，這是合宜的，因為那使人分別為聖的，和那些被分別為聖的，都是出於同一位。因這理由，祂稱他們為弟兄，並不以為恥。」(希伯來書 2:10-11)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">簡而言之：我們都已經完全破產了，而且賴帳的。只有基督有錢，能夠為我們付出代價，使我們擺脫債務。只有祂有財力使我們永遠保持沒有債務。祂之所以能做到，是因為祂是自由的、沒有任何債務的；祂什麼都不欠，也從來沒有。原因是祂是上帝; 天上地下的一切權力都是祂的。祂通過捨棄自己的生命，然後將自己從死裡復活來證明了這一點。如果你想以基督為你的榜樣，那麼你是在說你也有這些屬性，並且可以自己做所有這些事情，或者像我們正在反駁的那些傢伙，你真的並不在乎去試圖; 你只想在做自己的事情而被稱義，而且之後不會為此承擔後果，但你肯定會：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「不要自欺；神是輕慢不得的，因為人種的是甚麼，收的也是甚麼。」(加拉太書 6:7)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">那麼希伯來書第五章七節呢？亞當斯提出來支持他的觀點，即基督需要為自己獲得救贖？這是經節：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「基督在祂肉身的日子裡，曾經用強烈的呼號和淚水，向能救祂脫離死亡的那一位獻上了祈禱和懇求，就因著祂的虔誠蒙了垂聽。」(希伯來書 5:7)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">誰說，因為祂是上帝，耶穌沒有作為人子受苦？這是奇妙的事情，上帝成了我們中的一個，並且像我們一樣受試探，甚至更多。祂被自己的人民所憎恨和拒絕，甚至祂的親密夥伴和朋友也不相信祂，因為祂面臨著極度痛苦的處決，而這些事情對祂來說是痛苦的考驗。除了將自己交給萬靈之父，祂還能做什麼 (詩篇二十二敘述祂的祈禱和懇求)？詩人談到祂的清白：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「他們大家聚集攻擊義人，將無辜的人定為死罪。但主向來做了我的高臺，我的神做了我投靠的磐石。」(詩篇 94:21-22)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">無辜的人不需要救贖。因為祂在肉身受苦，並不意味著基督有罪，需要救贖。它實際上意味著相反的意思，因為祂為我們做了這件事，赦免我們對祂所做的一切。由於我們墮落的罪孽，祂遭受了極大的侮辱，忍受了罪人的頂撞，給我們帶來完全赦免。這表明祂是無罪的，並且通過克服祂的艱辛，祂為我們所有人買了救贖：</p>\n<p>以賽亞書 53:10-11<br />\n(10) 主卻喜悅把祂壓傷，使祂受痛苦；主若以祂的性命作贖罪祭，祂必看見後裔，並且得享長壽；主所喜悅的，必在祂手中亨通。<br />\n(11) 祂受了生命之苦以後，必看見光明，並且心滿意足；我的義僕必使許多人因認識祂而得稱為義，祂也必背負他們的罪孽。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">上帝的獨生子受苦這一事實並沒有使上帝變成遙遠；這讓祂更接近，在那些相信的人需要的時候。祂沒有顧惜自己的獨生子，為了使我們與祂和好，在我們還是祂的仇敵的時候; 更何況在我們通過基督成為祂的朋友，並且祂住在我們裡面之後呢？萊克奇和亞當斯沒有到這個情況，所以他們不會知道這些事，主的試探的意義和祂拯救的大能。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞當斯聲稱主耶穌基督，如果祂是神，神性的化身，對於無法與祂聯繫或被祂的榜樣所感動的人來說太遙遠了。對於認識祂的人來說，這是完全不真實的。耶穌基督作為主與那些信的人非常接近，那些信靠祂而不是他們自己，但與那些不信的人遙遠，那些信靠他們自己並且喜歡謊言而不是真理的人。他們尋找卻尋不見，因為他們不是全心全意地尋找，常常學習，卻始終不能明白真理。他們服事其它神明。他們可以在遇到困難的時候呼求上帝，但祂不回答，因為他們恨惡知識，不敬畏主，哪他們以各種方式嘲笑 (箴言1:26)。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>基督超然的優越性</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞當斯問：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“<span style=\"color:

justify;\">亞當斯的答案是，這些結果都是上帝的計劃。這是一個陳腐而不令人滿意的答案。任何事情都可以這麼說，沒有人會更明智的了。但無論如何，亞當斯的假設是錯誤的。他又一次把事情搞反了。基督的本性遠超亞當的本性，我可以證明 (並且已經證實了它)。經上有記載：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">經上也這樣記著：「第一個人亞當成了有生命的人，末後的亞當成了賜生命的靈。」不過在先的不是屬靈的，而是屬血氣的；在後的才是屬靈的。第一個人是出於地，是屬塵土的；末後的亞當是出於天。(哥林多前書 15:45-47)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:

那天使對他們說：「不要懼怕！看哪！因為我報給你們大喜的信息，是關乎萬民的：<br />\n(11) 因今天在大衛的城裏，為你們生了救主，就是<strong><em>主</em></strong>基督。<br />\n(12) 你們要看見一個嬰孩，包着布，臥在馬槽裏，那就是給你們的記號。」<span style=\"color:

這是上帝祂自己，賜生命的靈之人耶穌基督，祂不僅能在試煉中得勝，還能救贖亞當、他的子孫，以及歷代以來的所有受造物。這不僅僅是亞當犯罪而基督沒有犯罪的問題，而且是基督將亞當和全人類從死亡中救出來的事情。祂勝利的後果不僅指向祂成為了誰，還指向祂從一開始就是誰，以至於祂有能力完成祂為我們所做的事：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「可是，從亞當到摩西，死就掌權了，甚至那些不像亞當那樣犯罪的人，也在死的權下；亞當正是要來的那一位的預表。但恩賞和過犯是截然不同的；如果因著那一人的過犯，眾人都死了，神的恩典和這一人耶穌基督在恩典裡的賞賜，對眾人就更加豐盛了。 這賞賜和那一人犯罪的後果也是不同的；因為審判是由一人而來，以致定罪，恩賞卻由許多過犯而來，以致稱義。如果因著那一人的過犯，死就因那一人而掌權，那些蒙豐富的恩典並且得公義為賞賜的，就更要因這一位耶穌基督在生命中掌權了。這樣看來，因一次的過犯，所有人都被定罪；照樣，因一次的義行，所有人都被稱義得生命了。」(羅馬書 5:14-18)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「原來，就像在亞當裡所有的人都死了，照樣，在基督裡所有的人也都將得以復活。」(哥林多前書 15:22)</p>\n<p>救贖我們唯一的那個就是上帝我們的救主：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「凡有血氣的必都知道我主是你的救主，是你的救贖主，是雅各的大能者。」(以賽亞書 49:26)</p>\n<p

justify;\">通過這些話，亞當斯從他肉體思想中說，是上帝選擇了基督作為祂的選民，而不是基督做了一切。相比之下，基督是無關緊要的。但以賽亞在上帝的啟發下繼續說：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「我是主，這是我的名；<strong>我必不把我的榮耀歸給別人</strong>，也不把我當受的稱讚歸給雕刻的偶像。」(以賽亞書 42:8)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">那麼，基督怎麼可能不是上帝、父和子，因為基督的名和人肯定得了榮耀？以下是這個不變事實的幾個例子：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「祂 <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[真理之靈]</span>

14:1)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">是的，有兩個實體，但被榮耀和敬拜的是一個神。耶穌派猶大出賣祂之後，祂說：</p>\n<p>「現在人子得了榮耀，神也在人子身上得了榮耀。神既然在人子身上得了榮耀，神也要在自己身上榮耀人子，並且要立刻榮耀祂。」(約翰福音 13:31-32)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:

#0000ff;\">基督最後的苦難和死亡是一個人類的…根據約翰福音第十章十七十八節，耶穌捨的命又取回來的不是他天然的生命，而是他先前存在的、神聖的生命。</span>”</p>\n<p>既然基督的苦難和死亡是一個人類的，那麼祂所取回來的怎麼不是天然的生命呢？祂不是對多馬說：「把你的指頭伸到這裡來，看看我的手吧。伸出你的手來，放進我的肋旁吧。不要不信，而要信！」(約翰福音20:27)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">這是祂死前的同一具身體。祂還對門徒說：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「你們看我的手、我的腳，就知道實在是我了。摸我看看，靈沒有骨，沒有肉；你們看，我是有的。」(路加福音 24:39)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">如果耶穌基督不是取回祂天然的生命，那麼我們任何人無論是現在還是下一個領域都沒有希望。如果不是我們天然的生命，那麼上帝在復活什麼？我已經講過基督復活的大能，使我們在今生能行在上帝的大能中，但祂豈不是也應許要使<strong>萬有復興</strong>嗎 (使徒行傳 3:21)？是的，被升起的身體是一個靈性的身體，但首先需要有身體上的種子，哪天然的。然而，我們知道，我們的信心不是徒勞的，儘管亞當斯的信心是人為的是虛假的。他不知道也不承認耶穌基督 (上帝) 以肉身 (天然) 而來的。這就是敵基督的靈。那麼他怎麼能知道在基督裡的復活呢？</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">再一次：儘管祂是天然界的其中一個人，但基督卻不是普通的人：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">站在祂對面的百夫長，看見祂這樣斷氣，就說：「這個人真是神的兒子！」(馬可福音 15:39)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌在本質和現實上親自應驗了祂的話，反映了祂創造的一個比喻：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「我確確實實地告訴你們：一粒麥子如果不落在地裡死去，它仍然是一粒；如果死了，就結出很多子粒來。」(約翰福音 12:24)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">通過接受世界對祂的審判 (死亡)，上帝在基督裡扭轉了世界的局面，為了以審判並救贖它脫離死亡。上帝的兒子將上帝的審判帶給世界，因為祂也是人子：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「原來，父怎樣在自己裡面有生命，也照樣使子在自己裡面有生命；並且把審判的權柄交給了祂，因為祂是人子。」(約翰福音 5:26-27)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">所有人都是罪人，都需要被審判 (糾正)。通過在這個敗壞的領域成為一個人，並且沒有罪惡地生活，上帝在人格耶穌基督裡，捨棄祂的生命，哪我們不公正地從祂奪走的，赦免了我們，並獲得了榮耀和權利來審判我們，不是至於定罪，而是至於救恩：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「人子來不是要滅人的生命，是要救人的生命。」(路加福音 9:56)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">說基督沒有取回祂天然的生命，就是拒絕為所有人的復活，詛咒他們留在罪惡和死亡之中，沒有希望。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞當斯：“<span style=\"color:

justify;\">如果基督沒有優勢，那麼祂如何成為我們的救主，為什麼我們還需要祂？如果祂不是上帝，為什麼聖經都是關於祂，直到最終祂的顯現呢？這真的歸結為：如果你認為你和耶穌基督一樣，那麼你一定是神。如果你認為祂是與你一樣，那你的神明就是敗壞的，本質上非常低劣的，而我們都是沒有希望的。</p>\n<p><strong>榮耀和敬拜只屬於上帝</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">接下來，肯尼斯·萊克奇談到三位一體的教義，正確地指出聖經說有一位上帝，而不是三位。可以肯定的是，三位一體是一個可惡的教義，尤其是因為它被呈現為上帝高貴和神聖的肖像/概念。是異教神明裝扮扮演的角色，這是一種令人困惑和令人作嘔的混合物，剝奪了上帝的威嚴和聖潔。屬上帝的人從來沒有教過這個。然而，由於聖經宣稱只有一位上帝，正確地譴責三位一體是錯誤的，而不是支持萊克奇的論點，而是摧毀了基督不是上帝的觀念。如果只有一位上帝，而且確實是，那麼耶穌基督一定是祂，因為祂有上帝的榮耀、尊貴和敬拜：</p>\n<p>啟示錄 5:12-14<br />\n(12) 他們大聲說：「那被殺的羔羊配接受權能、財富、智慧、力量、尊貴、榮耀和頌讚！」<br />\n(13) 我又聽見天上、地上、地底下和海中的一切被造之物，以及天地間的萬有，都在說：「願頌讚、尊貴、榮耀和權能，都歸於坐在寶座上的那一位，<br />\n都歸於羔羊，直到永永遠遠！」<br />\n(14) 四個活物就說：「阿們！」二十四個長老長也都俯伏敬拜<strong><em>祂</em></strong> [單數] 。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">只有一個擁有上帝的一切權能、尊貴和榮耀，那就是上帝祂自己，正如所呈現的，是單數。獨一真神通過摩西向以色列人作的見證是：「<strong>除了我以外，你不可有別的神。」</strong>你知道這些話是基督說的嗎？</p>\n<p>哥林多前書 10:1-4<br />\n(1) 弟兄們，我不願意你們不明白：我們的祖先曾經都在那雲彩之下，都從那海中經過，<br />\n(2) 並且都在那雲裡和海裡受洗歸於摩西。<br />\n(3) 他們都吃了同樣的屬靈食物，<br />\n(4) 也都喝了同樣的屬靈之水。<strong>原來他們所喝的是出於那隨著他們的屬靈磐石；那磐石就是基督。</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">根據使徒保羅的說法，耶穌基督是在曠野撫養以色列人的那一位。此外，我可以更清楚地表明保羅是如何明確地將基督等同於上帝。他寫了：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「我們也不可試探基督，像他們中的有些人試探了，結果就被蛇所滅。」(哥林多前書 10:9)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">保羅非常清楚，他提到的經文大約寫於基督時代之前十五個世紀，它說百姓曾試探上帝：</p>\n<p>百姓向神和摩西發怨言，說：「你為甚麼把我們從埃及領上來，使我們死在曠野呢？這裏沒有糧食，沒有水，我們厭惡這淡而無味的食物。」主派火蛇進入百姓當中去咬他們，於是以色列中死了許多百姓。(民數記 21:5-6)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">他們試探的是誰？是上帝還是耶穌基督？如果有兩個，為什麼不指定：「這是父神在做這事，」而「這是子神在做另一件事」？答案是，沒有兩個，只有一個上帝，他們向祂發怨言，試探祂。保羅不是三位一體論者，甚至不是二位一體論者。他是一個真正的以色列人，知道只有一個上帝！</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">值得注意的是，百姓將責任歸咎於代表上帝的那個人摩西，站在他們面前，他們說：「你為甚麼…」經上記載他們責備的是上帝，因為祂按照祂的命令派遣了摩西，他們反抗摩西奉祂的名所做的事。摩西和先知預示著上帝最終會通過一個人而來，祂的兒子，甚至根據耶穌所說的比喻：</p>\n<p>馬可福音 12:1-8<br />\n(1) 耶穌開始用比喻對他們說：「有一個人栽種了一個葡萄園，四面圍上籬笆，挖了一個榨酒池，蓋了一座守望樓，然後把葡萄園租給一些農夫，就出外旅行。<br />\n(2) 到了收穫的季節，他就派了一個奴僕到那些農夫那裡去，好從他們收取葡萄園的果子。<br />\n(3) 但他們抓住那奴僕，打了他，叫他空手回去。<br />\n(4) 園主又派另一個奴僕到他們那裡去。那些農夫打傷了他的頭，並且侮辱他。<br />\n(5) 園主再派另一個去，他們把他殺了。另派了許多去，有的被打，有的被殺。<br />\n(6) 那園主還有一位——是他的愛子。最後他差派兒子到他們那裡，說：『他們一定會尊重我的兒子。』<br />\n(7) 可是那些農夫彼此說：『這是繼承人。來，我們把他殺了，那繼業就歸我們了。』<br />\n(8) 於是他們抓住他，把他殺了，並扔出葡萄園外。」</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">在上帝的兒子基督裡，上帝也被拒絕了。「祂到自己的地方來，自己的人倒不接待祂」(約翰福音1:11)。祂提醒祂的信徒要期待同樣的事情：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「學生所遭遇的與老師一樣，僕人所遭遇的與主人一樣，也就夠了。既然有人罵一家的主人是『別西卜』，更何況祂的家人呢？」(馬太福音 10:25)</p>\n<p>耶穌是主和主人。是哪個家的主人？「 …<strong><em>神的</em></strong>家。這家是永生神的教會，是真理的柱石和根基」(提摩太前書3:15)。<br />\n上帝會以人的身份進入祂的故事，這難道不是一個奧秘嗎？</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「正如大家所承認的，敬神的奧祕是極大的：神以肉身顯現，被聖靈證實，被天使觀看，被傳於列國，被世人信仰，被接在榮耀裡。」(提摩太前書3:16)</p>\n<p><strong>憑藉口頭的服事是騙人的</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">好像亞當斯的一篇文章還不夠，萊克奇現在開始了第二篇，奇怪地題為《基督的神性》。我之所以說「奇怪，」是因為它進行折磨人的和對聖經的扭曲推想，通過肉體的邏輯，試圖證明與它所說的完全相反。好像有人寫了一篇文章《我的貓的貓性》，其中他試圖證明他的貓確實是老鼠。在這種無關緊要的事情上，這可能很有趣，但沒有比耶穌基督是誰更重要的事情了，亞當斯當然不是想逗我們開心。他絕對地認真，並絕對地死的。許多人也是如此，因為他們不認識基督是誰，也不相信在天下人間，賜給我們的<strong><em>唯一</em></strong>名字，我們可以靠著得救。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">許多在死亡中行走的人並沒有自稱相信。他們通常比那些自稱信奉耶穌，卻跟從虛假的基督和福音 (例如亞當斯所講道的) 的人更好。其中亞當斯講道基督是神聖的，但祂不是上帝，因此也不是救主。這些是對上帝和真實信仰的嘲弄。根據亞當斯的說法，上帝只是在耶穌身上加了一些神性。他的理由是，如果基督與我們沒有什麼不同，並且祂可以被賦予這種敬虔，那麼你也可以，只要你效法祂的榜樣。然而，如果基督<strong><em>被賦予了</em></strong>神性，那麼有什麼人能做到呢？難道這不是恩賜，因此，不是出自接受者的人之手嗎？雖然亞當斯很輕易告訴你效法基督的榜樣，但他有這樣做嗎？誰能真正做到這一點？以下是耶穌對那些提出此類自助計劃的人所說的話：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「他們把難擔的重擔捆起來，擱在人的肩上，但自己一個指頭也不肯動。」(馬太福音 23:4)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞當斯會讓你以為他已經做到了，所以你應該聽他的，因為他知道他在說什麼。虛假的傳教人把人引向他們自己和他們的知識，而不是引向主耶穌並順服祂。他們以光明使者的名份來，承認祂的名字，對祂有一些了解，但在真理和實質上否認祂。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">他們拒絕了祂，以便他們可以行使權力來代替祂，以便隨心所欲。有一位命令他們的，祂作為他們的正當主人的想法，是被鄙視的。「主」不在他們的詞彙中，只是口頭上的的服事。他們自稱祂是榜樣，因為他們對於祂是主毫無用處。他們不服從任何人，除非這對他們有益處。真理不掌權，只有權宜之計。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">他們想要基督工作的益處，但不想為這些好處付出入場費。他們避開十字架，哪個代表他們獨立主權的死亡。他們試圖通過另一種方式來獲得國王的財物。他們的結局是手腳被捆綁，拋在外面的黑暗裡。他們是騙子和盜賊，被同樣的人所欣然接受和相信。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">這一切都是按照上帝的旨意，祂把一種迷惑人的力量送進他們裡面，使他們相信虛假之事。這些是妥協者和不冷不熱的人，他們只說而不做。上帝知道如何聚集和保留他們來受審判。祂使萬事相輔相成，我們知道並理解這一點，因為祂已將我們從做自己的事情轉變為愛祂並遵守祂的誡命。祂保留那些屬於祂的人，他們不會跟從以祂的名義來的陌生人的聲音。</p>\n<p><strong>與證據相矛盾的結論是站不住腳的</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞當斯使用人的邏輯，即催生三位一體可憎教義的邏輯，來反對基督是全能的上帝。我引用：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">正統的觀點是，聖子基督與聖父上帝是同一的，信條說，耶穌是「正是非起源的上帝」；他們把這種荒謬和完全無法理解的教條稱為基督神性的教義…說基督自己絕對是上帝本身——子是他自己的父，這不僅毫無道理，而且完全不符合聖經的。</span>”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">這種推理的基本缺陷是假設因為耶穌是上帝，所以上帝必須被限制在一個有形的身體中，在一個地方一個時間生存，而不再是那個填滿創造和永恆的靈。這種想法是屬肉體的，並妄圖以自大和傲慢的嘲笑嚇倒你：「你怎麼會這麼愚蠢以至於相信兒是父！？」這不是一個有道理的論點。這是一個預先形成的結論，用來解釋單詞和事件。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞當斯憑什麼說上帝是如此有限，以至於祂不能作為一個人顯現？誰能告訴上帝祂不能這樣做，<strong>尤其是當祂已經這樣做到了</strong>？哇，如果祂以人的形式顯現，這是否意味著祂不再統治天上了嗎？對於上帝，經上有記載：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「祂若把靈與氣收歸自己，有血肉生命的就都一同氣絕身亡，世人都歸回塵土。」(約伯記 34:14-15)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">祂的靈而不是肉體維持著宇宙。記載這些話的經文作者都是同些人，他們向不同的聖徒講述了上帝作為一個人的幾次顯現，包括亞伯拉罕、雅各 (他與祂整夜摔跤！) 和約書亞，所有這些都是在祂的降臨在基督裡之前。人類在這些顯現的過程中並沒有消失，化為塵土，所以，當祂以人的形式生活在人間，為他們獻出祂的生命，為什麼會呢？當然，當祂作為人子來時，上帝並不僅限於肉身！子甚至說：「父比我大。」這如何使基督與父分開呢？相反，這與我所說的一致。上帝並沒有局限在人的身體裡；祂遠不止於此。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">許多人以我剛才引用的基督說的話父更大，以證明耶穌不是上帝，但是它們是嗎？這是祂所說的其餘內容：</p>\n<p>你們聽見我對你們說過：『我去，但還要回到你們這裡來。』你們若愛我，就要喜樂，『我到父那裡去，』因為父是比我大的。(約翰福音 14:28)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌作為一個有血有肉的人，祂在為門徒做的事情上受到限制，但祂承認當祂作為賜生命的靈回來時，祂可以做的更多。這證明而不是反駁祂是上帝。有什麼人或生物能做出這些種應許<strong>更不用說信守</strong>呢？主走了之後，升上天，又回到他們身邊，將祂的靈賜給他們，應驗了祂所說「父比我大」的意思。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">他們領受了上帝！耶穌基督居住在他們裡面，賜給他們祂對罪的同樣能力。更大的事情永遠不會發生在任何人身上，只有上帝可以為他們或你做的事情。</p>\n<p><strong>如果耶穌基督不是上帝——祂是誰？</strong></p>\n<p><em>約翰福音 12:23-28</em><br />\n<em>(23) 耶穌回答他們，說：「人子得榮耀的時候到了！」</em></p>\n<p>人子是如何得榮耀的？</p>\n<p><em>(24) 我確確實實地告訴你們：「一粒麥子如果不落在地裡死去，它仍然是一粒；如果死了，就結出許多果實來。」</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">當耶穌結出許多果實，即當祂的生命倍增時，祂就得到榮耀。然後人們將認識並尊敬上帝，因為他們將在基督裡認識祂，擁有祂的靈，即上帝的靈。上帝會在地上的器皿中顯現祂自己，就像祂在基督裡所做的那樣。你認為創造者居住的人不會經歷最深刻和最實質性的改變嗎？你認為基督在那個人身上的成熟不會對這個世界以及其它世界產生深遠的影響嗎？你認為這還沒有發生嗎？再想一想。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">施洗約翰對耶穌說：「我應該受祢的洗，祢卻到我這裡來嗎？」但當時未是麥子落在地裡死去，克服了死亡又復活了，使倍增的時候，在那些相信而領受祂的靈——即上帝的靈——的人裡面。那個時候不久之後便到了。基督回來了正如所​​應許，將我們從罪的死刑中解救出來，保羅稱其為「死亡的身體」(羅馬書7:24)。結出了果實！上帝得榮耀了！</p>\n<p><em>(25) 「愛惜自己生命的，就失去生命；在這世上恨惡自己生命的，將保全生命到永生。」</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">那些被召喚與上帝合而為一的人被召喚捨棄自己生命，基督將藉著祂復活的大能使他們復活，以便他們會藉著祂活著，沒有敗壞的，就像耶穌一樣。這是永生和律法的成全；榮耀歸給上帝！這不是模仿；它不是效法。是真正的！</p>\n<p><em>(26) 「一個人如果要服事我，就當跟從我；我在哪裡，我的僕人也將要在哪裡。如果有人服事我，父將尊重他。」</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">這個人是誰自願為殺死祂的人而死，在準確的時間將自己的身體從死裡復活，正如祂所說的那樣，向許多人顯現，多維度隨意來來去去，升上天，永遠活著，並且可以持續、不間斷地通知、溝通和命令祂所召喚和揀選為祂服事的人，無論他們的人數或地點如何，如果祂不是上帝？ 如果基督不是上帝，那祂到底是誰？萊克奇和亞當斯不是很困惑嗎？</p>\n<p><em>(27) 「現在我的靈魂煩擾。我該說什麼呢？說『父啊，救我脫離這時刻』嗎？但我正是為了這時刻而來的。 」</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">正是這樣的陳述使人們說基督不是上帝，因為如果祂是上帝，祂就不會與上帝說話。我們已經多次回答了這個反對意見，但是人們再次錯過了上帝藉著基督正在做的一切的整點。為了使人類按照祂的形像被造，一項工作在創造之初就開始了，但尚未完成，上帝成為了肉體來鋪平道路。祂必須顯示一個真正聖潔和完美的人將如何與上帝相處。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞當在墮落之前就沒有真正的聖潔和完美。否則，他不會選擇跟從另一個被造的生物，他的妻子，而不是上帝，他的創造者。沒有人天生是聖潔和完美的，這就是為什麼聖經說<strong>上帝必須親自把人帶到那種狀態</strong>。而祂做到了！只有祂有這種能力。是通過在基督裡接待祂，而不是通過效法祂，我們才能分享生命和能力去做需要做的的事情，而沒有祂我們是做不到的。這樣，祂，我們的創造者，使我們成為祂的形象，該基督。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「我是主，你的救贖主， 從你在母腹中就造了你，我是主 — 創造萬物，<strong><em>獨自</em></strong>鋪張諸天，展開大地，<strong><em>誰與我同在</em></strong>幫助我？」(以賽亞書 44:24)</p>\n<p><em>28 「父啊，榮耀祢的名！」這時候，有聲音從天上傳來：「我已經榮耀了我的名，還要再榮耀！」</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「榮耀祢的名！」人子得榮耀的時刻已經到了。父的名是什麼？人受洗歸入上帝，領受祂的靈唯一名字是什麼？天下人間，賜下唯一名字人必須靠著得救是什麼？</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">主耶穌基督！ (使徒行傳 4:12)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">因有一嬰孩為我們而生；有一子賜給我們。政權必擔在祂的肩頭上；祂名稱為「奇妙策士、全能的神、永在的父、和平的君。」(以賽亞書 9:6)</p>\n<p><strong>那位先於所有的就是上帝</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞當斯：“<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">耶穌說，「我與父是一體的」(約翰福音 10:30)。他的意思是說他們是同一個嗎？有必要採取這種極端和牽強的觀點嗎？</span>”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌基督與上帝合而為一有什麼極端和牽強的？我們不正在表明這是經上最核心和最重要的見證嗎？它只對那些對上帝一無所知的人牽強附會。上帝是靈，超越時空，存在於各個維度，並在各個維度上為所欲為。如果祂已宣佈祂在世上造的人是神 (詩篇82:6)，為什麼祂以人的身份進入人的空間是一個問題？我會告訴你，對於那些不認識祂，卻理論化祂的本性並抵制真理的人來說，問題是：當上帝不再只是一個靈，而是以肉身進入了他們的維度，祂可以直接與他們面對面地談論他們自己和他們的邪惡立場，他們的褻瀆神的理論由此而來，威脅到他們以自稱知識淵博而獲得的地位，即使這種地位僅存在於他們的腦海中。正是出於這個原因，宗教人士將主交給彼拉多被釘死在十字架上：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「其實彼拉多知道他們是出於嫉妒才把耶穌交給他的。」(馬太福音 27:18)</p>\n<p>但是祂回來了成倍增加，真理繼續前進，勢不可擋。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">讓我們在這裡再次指出，正如我們在其它寫作和信件中所指出的那樣，沒有人有資格選擇他對上帝的看法和意見，更糟糕的是，對它們持教條主義的態度。只有真理，藉著祂口中的話語，才是可以接受的，而上帝賜給我們恩典去尋求祂的面和認識祂，並沒有離開我們讓我們依靠自己。我們不宣講別人或我們自己制定的，而只宣講上帝親自向我們啟示的：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「要知道，我們從前讓你們明白我們主耶穌基督的大能和祂來臨的事，並不是隨從巧言編造的故事，相反，我們是親眼見過祂威榮的人。」(彼得後書 1:16)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「弟兄們，我要你們知道，我所傳的福音不是按照人的意思；因為我不是從人領受的，也不是人教導我的，而是藉着耶穌基督的啟示而來。」(加拉太書 1:11-12)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">至於肯尼斯·萊克奇和他所提倡的學說，我可以說更多關於他的矛盾。他引用亞當斯來解釋他的立場，即耶穌是一個軟弱、敗壞的人，被上帝賜予神聖，以激勵人效法祂的榜樣，成為同樣的人。然而，如果他們的目標是過敬神的生活，那麼他們不會對基督作為在肉身的上帝有異議，因為只有這樣，人才能領受上帝的能力過敬神的生活。那不是他們所尋求的。他們對從敗壞的深淵中被興起不感興趣；他們對現在自己的處境很滿意。他們看不到自己的狀態或危險，因為他們根本不相信。他們從未悔改過自己的罪惡，也對基督一無所知。跟從他們的人是瞎子，最終與他們掉進坑裡。讓他們垮倒在他們可能在哪裡的地方。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">對於肯尼斯等人的問題是，基督是上帝，使祂成為一個人生命的正當主宰，所有的順服和榮耀都歸於祂。為此，這些傳教士沒有心趣。取而代之的是，他們試圖以基督為榜樣的理論來中和現實，一個在他們的腦海中想像並在他們決定時跟隨的，如果有的話，允許他們為所欲為，對任何人不負責除了他們自己。復活的主耶穌基督不是他們想見的，也不是他們想听的。相反，對他們而言，耶穌基督已經死了，他們為保持這種狀態而戰，他們是那些殺死祂的人的子女。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">但是耶穌基督是活著的，並且藉著祂的恩典而不是我們自己的能力或公義使我們與上帝合而為一。在基督裡的新生命是上帝以肉身而來，藉著祂的旨意而不是人的意志 (約翰福音1:13)。耶穌說，那些由靈所生的就像風；人不知道它們從哪裡來，往哪裡去。那麼，人又怎能效法祂呢？顯然他不能。耶穌基督是上帝使兩者——上帝(基督)和人(祂的教會)——合而為一的方法，以便祂的旨意行在地上，如同行在天上。保羅不是說在基督裡上帝與人結合成為一體，是一個極大的奧祕嗎 (以弗所書5:32)？</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">天上與地上結合成為可能是通過父化身作為子。父與子的完全相同是在靈中。有一個靈，祂是上帝。經上交替地談到基督的靈和上帝的靈。那是因為基督是上帝，上帝是靈，祂只有一個。祂隨心所欲地顯現祂自己，以完成祂的旨意。人算什麼，他對這個成問題？</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞當斯：“<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">他是第一個按照上帝的形像和樣式被造的人，是上帝的完成創造模式人。這種觀點符合理性和經文。說耶穌基督是上帝永恆的子是胡說八道。這些話對我們的頭腦沒有任何意義，因為我們無法想像一個子與他的父共存，就像我們無法想像一個圓形的正方形或一個直的曲線一樣。</span>”</p>\n<p>這是上帝說的：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「我的意念非同你們的意念，你的工作方式不是我的工作方式——上帝的法令。」(以賽亞書 55:8)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「因為神在祂的智慧裡，讓人無法憑自己的智慧認識祂。反而，藉着我們所傳『愚拙』的話，神決定拯救那些相信的人。」(哥林多前書 1:21)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「之所以如此，是因為敗壞的本性對神懷有敵對的心態。它拒絕順服神律法的權威之下，因為它不能。」(羅馬書 8:7)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「然而，屬血氣的人不領會神的靈的事，他反倒以為愚拙；並且不能知道，因為這些事唯有屬靈的人才能看透。」(哥林多前書 2:14)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌基督不是第一個按照上帝的樣式被造的人。事實並非如此。祂是上帝成為人的樣式 (腓立比書2:7)。祂來完成從亞當開始的過程，亞當是第一個人按照上帝的形象被造的人，經上有記載：</p>\n<p>神說：「我們要照着我們的形像，按着我們的樣式造人，使他們管理海裏的魚、天空的鳥、地上的牲畜和全地，以及地上爬的一切爬行動物。」 神就照着祂的形像創造人，照着神的形像創造他；祂創造了他們，有男有女。(創世記 1:26-27)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">因此，亞當被稱為神的兒子 (路加福音 3:38)。至於耶穌基督，亞當的救主和上帝永恆的獨生子，這是聖經所說的關於祂：</p>\n<p><em>希伯來書 1:6-8</em><br />\n<em>(6) 神差遣長子到世上來的時候，又說：「神的使者都要拜祂。」</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌基督先於亞當，高高在上，甚至還有比人類更高的上帝的使者都要拜祂。</p>\n<p><em>(7) 關於使者，祂說：「以祂的使者為靈，以祂的僕役為火焰。」</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">雖然人們比使者低 (詩篇8:5-6)，在這是使者奉命要敬拜唯一的那個，並命令使者，使他們為火焰。基督怎樣指揮天上的使者？因為祂不是按照上帝的形象被造的人，而是以人的形式顯現的上帝。</p>\n<p><em>(8) 關於子，祂卻說：「神啊，祢的寶座是永永遠遠的；祢國度的權杖是正直的權杖。」</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">對亞當斯來說，這是胡說八道，因為上帝無法與祂自己對話。問題不在於上帝，而在於亞當斯，他被困在他屬世的、屬肉體的頭腦中，他高舉這種頭腦，好像它可以理解上帝、創造者和永恆的靈。他不經意間就忘記了耶穌說祂在創世<strong><em>之前</em></strong>就擁有了上帝的榮耀 (約翰福音 17:24)。那也是廢話嗎？受諸靈之父啟發的聖經是一本屬靈的書，而不是一本屬肉體的書。</p>\n<p><strong>使徒宣告耶穌基督為上帝</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞當斯：“<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">這樣，使徒稱基督為上帝的兒子 (例如，使徒行傳9:20)，但他們都沒有留下任何暗示，他們認為基督「正是非起源的上帝」。</span>”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">那些以他們屬肉體的思想和知識自信的是多麼又聾又瞎的，他們又是多麼的冒昧地說出自己的無知，好像對上帝祂自己有知識一樣！使徒們毫無疑問地相信基督正是上帝。他們將他介紹為上帝的兒子，這絕不會取消這一點，因為除非你認識上帝在基督的身分上，即上帝的兒子，否則你無法真正認識祂。耶穌基督是道路，通過祂所有人才能認識上帝：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「我父把一切都交給了我。除了父，沒有人知道子是誰；<strong>除了子和子所願意啟示的人</strong>，也沒有人知道父是誰。」(路加福音 10:22)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">基督是上帝，上帝是基督這一真理，已融入使徒所寫的一切之中。我們已經看過保羅的一些寫作，但也考慮他書信裡的這些經節：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「奉我們的救主神，和我們的盼望基督耶穌的命令，作基督耶穌使徒的保羅。」(提摩太前書 1:1)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">如果上帝是我們的救主，而耶穌基督是我們的救主 (腓立比書3:20)，而只有一個救主，那麼上帝和耶穌基督便是同一個。如果我們是快樂的人，因為我們的盼望在主我們的上帝身上 (詩篇145:6)，而基督是我們的盼望，那麼耶穌基督就是主我們的上帝。保羅也正是這樣說的：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「期待那蒙福的盼望，就是那偉大的神和我們的救主耶穌基督榮耀的顯現。」(提多書 2:13)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">這是他寫給提摩太信中的另一句話，我們已經看到了，但值得仔細看一下：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「正如大家所承認的，敬神的奧祕是極大的：神以肉身顯現，被聖靈證實，被天使觀看，被傳於列國，被世人信仰，被接在榮耀裡。」(提摩太前書3:16)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">誰以肉身顯現？上帝。那同一個被傳於列國是誰？耶穌基督。這節經文講的是一個上帝，而不是兩個，明顯地<strong><em>主</em></strong>耶穌基督，祂被接在榮耀裡。保羅宣告敬虔的奧秘，而屬肉體宗教人士，例如肯尼斯和亞瑟·亞當斯，他們不相信永生上帝是他們的救主，他們並沒有察覺或理解這一奧秘。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「事實上，我們勞苦、遭受譴責正是為此，因為我們把盼望寄託於<strong>永生的神——祂是所有人的救主</strong>，尤其是信徒的救主。」(提摩太前書 4:10)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「要守這命令，毫不玷污，無可指責，直到我們的主耶穌基督顯現。祂到了適當的時候要表明出來：祂是那可稱頌的、獨一的全能者，萬王之王，萬主之主。只有祂永遠不死，住在不能接近的光裡，沒有人見過祂，人也不能看見祂。願尊貴和永遠的權能都歸給祂。阿們！」(提摩太前書 6:14-16)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">這些經節顯然是在談論耶穌基督，但是卻說沒有人能看見祂。這怎麼可能？祂在一個有血有肉的身體。但是上帝是靈，只有藉著靈的啟示，人才能看見祂。祂在適當的時候會表明，而現在是時候到了，祂是唯一的統治者，萬王之王，萬主之主，永恆的那一位，所有的榮譽都歸於祂。讚美上帝，榮耀歸於至高之處！</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">一個人如何效法他沒有見過的？但是，如果他憑藉著信心看到「主的榮耀，他正在被改變成與主同樣的形像，從榮耀歸入榮耀，如同從主的靈變成的」(哥林多後書 3:18)。阿們。</p>\n<p>彼得還教導說耶穌是上帝：</p>\n<p>「耶穌基督的僕人和使徒西門‧彼得寫信給那因我們的神和救主耶穌基督的義，與我們同得一樣寶貴信心的人。」(彼得後書 1:1)</p>\n<p>彼得清楚地承認耶穌基督是我們的上帝和救主。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「這樣，必叫你們豐豐富富地得以進入我們主和救主耶穌基督永遠的國度。」(彼得後書 1:11)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">我們的主和救主耶穌基督的永遠國度是上帝的王國。在哪裡可以找到兩個永恆的天國？也沒有兩個神。只有一個——耶穌基督。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「願恩典與平安，藉著你們真正認識神，我們的主耶穌，多多地加給你們。」(彼得後書 1:2)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「你們要在我們的主和救主耶穌基督的恩典和知識中不斷長進。願榮耀歸於祂，從現在直到永遠之日！阿們。」(彼得後書 3:18)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">彼得所寫的內容沒有什麼棘手或複雜的。對上帝的認識來自對我們的主和救主的認識。上帝的榮耀永遠歸於<strong><em>祂</em></strong>。正如我們已經聽到的，上帝的榮耀是獨屬於上帝的。事情變得複雜的地方在於否認耶穌是上帝的理論和論點，從而使人與上帝分離，上帝與人分離。支持這一錯誤的人既沒有接待上帝也沒有進入祂的王國。他們試圖阻止那些可能這樣做的人。他們希望保留自己的權力，不受祂的審判。黑暗抵抗光，但不會成功。</p>\n<p>使徒雅各也作證基督是上帝：</p>\n<p>雅各書 5:7-11<br />\n(7) 所以弟兄們，你們當恆久忍耐，直到主的來臨。看哪，農夫等待著田地裡寶貴的果實，為此恆久忍耐，直到果實得著秋雨春雨。<br />\n(8) 你們也當恆久忍耐，堅固你們的心，因為主的來臨已經近了。<br />\n(9) 弟兄們，不要彼此埋怨，免得你們受審判。看哪，審判者已經站在門口了！<br />\n(10) 弟兄們，你們要把那些奉主名講話的先知當做受苦和忍耐的榜樣。<br />\n(11) 看哪，那些忍耐過的人，我們稱他們有福！你們聽說過約伯的忍耐，也看見了主所賜給他的結局，知道主是充滿憐憫和仁慈的。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">雅各在即將來臨的那一位 (基督) 與通過先知講話並隨時審判世界，並向祂的僕人表示憐憫的那一位之間沒有區別——上帝。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞伯拉罕在將滅所多瑪的事上對上帝，對那站在他面前的一個人說：「審判全地的主豈不做公平的事嗎？」(創世記18:25)。萬有只有一位審判者，而事實是祂不止一次地以人的身份出現。記載是詳細和一致的。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">確實，正如耶穌所說：「亞伯拉罕存在之前，我就存在了」(約翰福音8:58)，亞伯拉罕正是預言了祂，那是上帝將完成以撒的獻祭：</p>\n<p>以撒對他父親亞伯拉罕說：「我父啊！火與柴都有了，但燔祭的羔羊在哪裏呢？」亞伯拉罕說：「我兒，神必自己預備燔祭的羔羊。」(創世記 22:7-8)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">上帝也通過先知撒迦利亞談到了這一點，毫無疑問，是祂完成了羔羊的角色：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「我必把那恩慈與懇求的靈傾注在大衛家和耶路撒冷居民的身上。<strong>他們必仰望我，就是他們所刺的；他們要為祂哀哭</strong>，好像喪獨生子；他們必為祂悲痛，好像喪長子。」(撒迦利亞書 12:10)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">約翰是耶穌所愛的門徒，也是所有在基督裡的人患難中的使徒和弟兄，他寫了一本關於耶穌基督的啟示的書。如果不是啟示上帝，這個啟示的目的或意義是什麼？這就是聖經所說的：</p>\n<p>「那吩咐光從黑暗裏照出來的神已經照在我們心裏，使我們知道神榮耀的光顯在耶穌基督的臉上。」(哥林多後書 4:6)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">我們在約翰的寫作看到，耶穌基督的啟示就是上帝的啟示。從一開始，這與上帝的記載是一致的：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「主又在示羅顯現，因為主在示羅<strong>藉祂的道</strong>向撒母耳啟示祂自己。」(撒母耳記上 3:21)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「太初有道，道與神同在，道就是神。」(約翰福音 1:1)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「道成了肉身，居住在我們中間。我們看到了祂的榮耀，正是從父而來的獨生子的榮耀，充滿了恩典和真理。」(約翰福音 1:14)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">在啟示錄中，約翰描述了他與升天的主的相遇：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">我一看見祂，就仆倒在祂的腳前，像死人那樣。祂把右手放在我身上，說：「不要怕！我就是首先的，是末後的，是那永生的。我曾經死過，可是看哪，我現在活著，直到永永遠遠，並且拿著死亡和陰間的鑰匙。」(啟示錄 1:17-18)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">約翰在基督面前像死人一樣仆倒的反應與其他人看到上帝的反應是一樣的。以西結看見上帝的樣子像人的形象坐在寶座上，就俯伏在祂腳前。然後上帝命令他站起來聽，上帝的靈進入他裡面，使他站起來，使他聽見。但以理看見上帝是一個得了榮耀的人，臉伏在地上沉睡了，全身無力，感覺完全是敗壞的。猶太人，上帝的道被賜給他們，我們通過他們得到祂的記載，從不懷疑這些是全能上帝的顯現。使徒和耶穌基督的啟示也是如此。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">事實上，約翰記載下來他的異象和他從上帝那裡得到的理解，以便那些相信基督的人可以確切地知道他們所信的那一位——全能的上帝：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">約翰一書 5:13-15, 20</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(13)

我們也知道：神的兒子已經來了，並且把領悟的心賜給了我們，使我們能認識祂，真實的那一位。<strong>我們也在祂裡面，真實的那一位，在祂的兒子耶穌基督裡面。這一位就是真神，就是永恆的生命。</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">約翰在基督的啟示錄宣布，那一位曾經死過而永遠活著就是主神，掌管萬有：</p>\n<p

justify;\">使徒多馬從當主復活後多馬看見主時，就正面表白認耶穌基督是主和神：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">多馬回答，對祂說：「我的主！我的神！」(約翰福音 20:28)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">他知道只有上帝才能預言祂自己的復活並實現了它。多馬是有懷疑過，但他並非完全無知。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">最後，我們有耶穌基督的見證，祂確實是多馬所說的祂，因為祂同意多馬所說的，而且我們知道祂所說的是真實的，因為我們是那些蒙福的人之一，可以在沒有看到祂在之後肉身的情況下，相信並接待祂：</p>\n<p>耶穌對他說：「你因為看到了我才信嗎？那沒有看到就信的人，是蒙福的。」(約翰福音 20:29)</p>\n<p><strong>靈使人活的；肉體無濟於事的</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">因此，經文所宣告的與亞當斯所說的完全相反，然而他，一個沉迷於自己的肉體推理的人，對這種可能想法表示極大的憤慨。膽大妄為是他，他是冒犯者。這是他傲慢而困惑的論點的另一個例子：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">或許有人會問，保羅才不是說基督「與神平等」嗎？(腓立比書2:6) 如果他真的這麼說，那也不是說他與神是完全相同。但是保羅沒有說任何類似的事情。相反，他說的恰恰相反。該子句是誤譯；它應該是這樣寫的：「他認為與上帝平等並不是一件容易明白的事情。」</span>”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">我們已經表明，反對基督在祂肉身的日子是上帝，因為上帝不是肉身，因此祂不是「相同的，」這種論點是虛假的。上帝不是灌木叢中的火焰，但祂以這種方式向摩西顯現。亞伯拉罕看見祂是人的形像，但亞伯拉罕知道上帝不只是一個人。並不是所有是關於實物的：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「使人活的是靈，肉體是無濟於事的。我對你們所說的話是靈、是生命。」(約翰福音 6:63)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌是上帝在肉身中的表達，即同一個靈。祂升天之後，祂在各方面都是同一的，因為祂從上帝那裡出來，又回到祂那裡：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「我從父那裡來，到了這世界；我又離開這世界，到父那裡去。」(約翰福音 16:28)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">上帝成了一個人，但祂始終是一個靈。這就是為什麼我們不認識肉身之後的基督。我們認識祂是末後的亞當，賜生命的靈。</p>\n<p>這是亞當斯引用的經文，實際上是關於基督的：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「祂就是神本體的存在 <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[“道就是上帝”]</span>，卻不堅持自己與神平等的地位 <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[沒有利用祂的地位]</span>，反而倒空自己 <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[倒空自己的榮耀和能力]</span>，取了奴僕的形象 <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[服事而不是被服事]</span>，成為人的樣式 <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">[在各個方面是個人，服從上帝的旨意]</span>。」(腓立比書 2:6-7)</p>\n<p>然後發生了什麼？</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「既然有人的樣子，就自甘卑微，順服至死，而且死在十字架上。因此神把祂升為至高，並且賜給祂超過萬名之上的名。使天上、地上和地底下的一切，因著耶穌的名，都要屈膝，並且口裡承認耶穌基督是主，使榮耀歸給父　神。」(腓立比書 2:8-11)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">如果基督不是上帝，那麼祂就不會有人向祂跪拜並承認祂是主。上帝的忠誠僕人永遠不會允許這樣的事情：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">我約翰，是聽見又看見這些事的人。我聽見又看見了以後，就俯伏在那位指示我這些事的天使腳前，要敬拜他。可是他對我說：「你要注意，不可這樣！我和你，以及你的弟兄先知們，還有那些遵守這書上話語的人，都是同做奴僕的。<strong>你應當敬拜神！</strong>」(啟示錄 22:8-9)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">如果按照亞當斯的說法，我們都像耶穌一樣，能夠以自己的能力達到祂的地位，那麼我們也應該受敬拜。彼得作為主要的門徒和首使徒，卻不這樣理解，正如被派往將基督的救恩帶給外邦人時所表明的：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">彼得一進去，哥尼流就迎接他，俯伏在他腳前拜他。但是彼得拉他起來，說：「你起來，我自己也是人。」(使徒行傳 10:25-26)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">那個只是一個人的人就不接受僅屬於上帝的那個敬拜。</p>\n<p><strong>另一個證明：你可以住在上帝裡面，但不能住在人裡面</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">但是亞當斯否認基督本性的真理，因為他寧願表現自己是上帝行事，而像上帝一樣，他不會將自己的榮耀給另一個人，即基督，祂實際上<strong><em>是</em></strong>上帝：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">耶穌成了「有血肉之體」(希伯來書 2:14)，即具有人的本性；在這篇文章中，我想展示信徒是如何成為「分享神的本性」(彼得後書 1:4)。每個基督徒都明白，我們必須捨己，拋棄一切，跟從耶穌在這裡受苦，如果我們將逐漸分享他的榮耀。</span>”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">我感謝上帝，耶穌成為「有血肉之體，」因為這是我們與祂的神性有份的唯一方式 (這是祂的，而不是我們的)。我們接待上帝並進入祂的工作，通過相信基督（靠祂而活，祂的話語和旨意，藉著祂的信心和靈)，祂是上帝所差來的 (約翰福音6:29)。我們進入生命不是以我們自己理解的榜樣跟從祂。跟從某人作為榜樣意味著你在理解力、權力和執行能力方面與榜樣相同。這個世界上沒有人曾經或將永遠擁有上帝的悟性、聖潔和成聖的能力來做耶穌基督所做的事，除非那個人是由祂生的，奉父、子和聖靈的名義受洗——耶穌基督。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">耶穌從來沒有想到過我們可以以我們的效法通往神性。祂知道我們的本體。祂沒有說「效法我」；祂說：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「<strong>你們要住在我裡面，我也就住在你們裡面。</strong>枝子若不連在葡萄樹上，自己就不能結果子；你們若不住在我裡面，也是這樣。」(約翰福音 15:4)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">那些效法耶穌的人並沒有住在祂裡面。儘管他們宣稱相反，但他們並沒有跟從祂受苦。他們根本沒有跟從祂，而當安下心來去做時，他們甚至不會試圖。相反，他們冒充葡萄樹，尋求自己的樹枝。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞當斯和萊克奇不想這樣做；他們只是籠統地談論這樣做。他們所經歷的苦難是<strong><em>他們自己的</em></strong>，很大程度上是由於徒勞地採用了主的名義，上帝的名而給自己帶來的。他們聲稱是屬於祂的，但與祂毫無關係。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">他們生活在一個唐吉訶德的世界現實中，一個他們自己創造的世界，他們自己是他們幻想中的英雄，依賴於他們敗壞的感官，而不是靠著上帝通過耶穌基督。他們誤解了他們所看到和處理的一切，在他們選擇的妄想中摧毀自己。(卡爾·馬克思是對的；宗教是群眾的鴉片，只有他錯誤地得出結論，因為人們為了自私的利益發明了他們自己版本的上帝，和虛構的與祂聯繫的方式，所以沒有上帝。馬克思是不信的，也是自私的。至少，馬克思的功勞以及亞當斯和萊克奇的羞愧是，馬克思並沒有冒昧地以任何方式代表耶穌基督，同時對祂一無所知。)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">雖然萊克奇和亞當斯沒有被召喚和揀選，但那些已經領受了上帝的恩典和祂的信心去和祂一起忍受並受苦的：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「我在磨煉之中，常和我同在的就是你們。」(路加福音 22:28)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞當斯，以一切虛假基督教的方式，教導人們以自己的意願、意圖和宣言來假定與基督的交往，而不是跟從祂的現實，通過信心仰的順從和將十字架引入祂所揀選的人的生活中，十字架是與祂認同和受苦的方式。亞當斯不能教他沒有的東西。他在那裡圈住簡單和虛偽的人。他和許多其他人一樣，使人們誤以為他們將憑自己的言論而不是憑自己的所作所為進入天國，因為他們自己都不知道真理和去做。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞當斯：“<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">無論他過去、現在或可能是什麼，它們必須是、正是和將是；哦，這個偉大的真理多麼接近把基督帶給信徒了！</span>”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">這就是我所說的極大的做作。謊言是耶穌基督是通過肯定或背誦某些關於祂的信仰或事實而來的。人算是什麼，認為他們可以由知識水平去聯想起上帝？這是那些從知善與惡樹上吃的人的果實。<strong><em>耶穌</em></strong>是主，但這對自信的傻瓜來說毫無意義。他們掌管，不會聽到別樣地。</p>\n<p>運用屬肉體的知識不是信心。事實上，信心拒絕它：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">唯有出於信心的義如此說：「你不要心裡說：誰要升到天上去呢？」——就是要領下基督來；「誰要下到陰間去呢？」——就是要領基督從死裡上來。(羅馬書 10:6-7)</p>\n<p>真正的信心承認耶穌基督是主：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">然而，這是怎麼說呢？「這話就在你身邊，在你口中，在你心裡。」這就是我們所傳的有關信仰的話語：你如果口裡承認耶穌是主，心裡相信神使祂從死人中復活，就將得救。(羅馬書 10:8-9)</p>\n<p><strong>你必須死才能成為神性</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">對於睜開眼睛的人來說，現在這已經很清楚了，事情並不像萊克奇和亞當斯所想或提議的那樣運作。我們只是在談論這兩個男人嗎？不。這涵蓋了主和使徒保羅保證會來的眾多假宗教教師，以各種各樣的教導 (包含真理的內容)，其中一些聽起來像這樣：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">他是我們的哥哥，與我們分享而我們與他分享墮落人類的所有經歷；並且仍然相互分享「完全人」(以弗所書 4:13) 的所有崇高和榮耀。這樣，神聖的耶穌就將他的神性賦予選民。應許的「後裔，」通過它可以將相同的神性傳遞給「地球上的所有家庭，」直到將有一個神聖的種族——神一樣的種族；——「不再有任何受咒詛的東西。」</span>”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">基督並沒有來為任何人卑躬屈膝。祂沒有與你們在你們的罪惡和放蕩中同在，無論是肉體還是靈性的。祂沒有與你們在你們的不信、倒退、世俗和知識宗教的自誇中同在。當你跟從圖像和偶像時，祂沒有背著你，沙灘上的一組腳印。祂不在你們的教會裡，人手的工作，這不是祂做的。祂呼召所有聽到祂聲音的人：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「所以主說：你們要從他們中間出來，要被分別出來；不要讓不潔淨的東西靠近你，我就接納你們。我要做你們的父，你們要做我的兒女。這是主、掌管萬有說的。」(哥林多後書 6:17-18)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">那些期望分享基督榮耀的人，因為他們認為基督在他們墮落的本性中與他們分享，將事情倒退了，並就會大吃一驚。肉體的生活和榮耀並不能使我們進入生命 (這不是這些人<strong><em>所說</em></strong>的他們在做的事情，但這是他們<strong><em>正</em></strong>在做的事情)。你們需要悔改，並按照祂的方式去做。以下是如何有起作用：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">這話是可信的：「我們若與基督同死，也必與祂同活；我們若能忍耐，也必和祂一同做王；我們若不認祂，祂也必不認我們。」(提摩太後書 2:11-12)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">是通過我們背起十字架和死去，而不是通過經歷肉體，才能與基督認同，隨之而來的是上帝的榮耀：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">美名優於美好的膏油，<strong>人死去的日子勝過他出生的日子</strong> (傳道書 7:1)。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">在主的眼中看來，祂信實的人的死極為寶貴。(詩篇 116:15)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「我已經與基督同釘十字架；所以現在活著的不再是我，而是基督在我裡面活著；並且如今我在肉體中活著，是因信而活，神的兒子的信心；祂愛我，甚至為我捨棄了自己。」(加拉太書 2:20)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">亞當斯試圖將神性、上帝的榮耀轉移到血肉之軀上，但經上另有聲明：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「弟兄們，我要告訴你們的是：血肉之軀不能承受神的國，必朽壞的也不能承受不朽壞的。」(哥林多前書 15:50)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">人不是種子。耶穌基督是種子。亞當斯與基督的靈相反，他想搶奪上帝並奪取祂的榮耀，但榮耀只在祂裡面：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">那些應許本來是給亞伯拉罕和他的後裔的。神並沒有說「給眾後裔，」好像指著多數；而是說「給你的一個後裔，」指著一個，就是基督 (加拉太書 3:16)。</p>\n<p>是的，我們是上帝在基督裡的後裔，但我們是合法地進入了祂裡面，通過祂的作為，而不是通過教義或假設而來的。<br />\n這是上帝親近的人：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「主親近心中破碎的人，祂拯救靈裡痛悔的人。」(詩篇 34:18)</p>\n<p><strong>耶穌基督——基石，不是英雄</strong></p>\n<p>肯尼斯在文章結尾說，其目的是：</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">我們可能會更好地欣賞拿撒勒人的勇氣和信仰，因此，「我們必須以忍耐去跑我們的賽程，我們的目光注視著耶穌，我們在信仰中的領袖和榜樣。」</span>”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">這使耶穌成為英雄，就像穆斯林對穆罕默德所做的那樣。肯尼斯剝奪了主耶穌基督祂的神性，使自己，一個罪人，與上帝平等。這正是穆罕默德所做的，他宣稱「上帝沒有兒子，」並為自己聲稱最後一位先知的地位，換句話說，給自己最後的話語權。這就是肉體的本質，它的極大傲慢和與上帝為敵。肯尼斯在靈裡是穆斯林，與所有篡位者和否認者、上帝的仇恨者和所有人的仇敵為伍。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">把耶穌造成英雄並不是給祂或你自己任何榮譽或恩惠。你這樣做不是為了祂，而是為了你自己。你抬高肉身，向它下拜，使它成為主宰，一個偶像。這是對人的敬拜。這就是古代巴力的意義所在；屬肉體的人是「主。」萊克奇在宣傳巴力，而不是基督。他利用主的名義和經文這樣做，欺騙簡單的人。他並不是唯一一個這樣做的人。世界充滿了巴力敬拜和虛假的宗教，對真理施行暴力，就像在挪亞時代，當潔淨與不潔淨混合在一起，一切都成為不合適。 「一點麵酵能使全團麵發起來。」一切都必須除掉，今日也是如此，並應許這一次淨化將通過火來：</p>\n<p>彼得後書 3:10-13<br />\n(10) 但主的日子必要像賊一樣來到。在那日，諸天必轟然一聲地消失，所有元素都因烈火而融化；地和地上所有的，都要被燒毀。<br />\n(11) 這一切既然都要這樣融化，你們應當怎樣為人，過著聖潔和敬虔的生活，<br />\n(12) 等候並催促神的日子降臨呢？因為在那日，天要被火焚燒就融化了，所有元素都因烈火而融解！<br />\n(13) 但是我們按照祂所應許的，等候新天新地，有公義在那裡居住。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">萊克奇寫，他希望提醒讀者注意上帝即將施行的審判，以及「這個世界的國將成為我們的主和祂的基督的王國」的時刻「快到了；<strong><em>祂</em></strong> [不是“祂們”] 要作王直到永永遠遠！」那一天就在這裡，現在，藉著真理——主耶穌基督，祂派遣我們這樣做——反駁所有的推定和錯誤。</p>\n<p>哥林多前書 3:10-15<br />\n(10) 我照著神賜給我的恩典，像一個有智慧的建築師，立好了根基，然後別人在上面建造；只是每個人應該當心怎樣在上面建造，<br />\n(11) 因為除了那已經立好的根基以外，沒有人能立別的；那根基就是耶穌基督。<br />\n(12) 如果有人用金、銀、寶石，木、草、禾秸在那根基上建造，<br />\n(13) 每個人的工程將來要顯露，因為那日子要把它顯明；原來它要被火顯現出來，這火要考驗每個人的工程是怎樣的。<br />\n(14) 如果有人所建造的工程能存留得住，這個人就將得到報償；<br />\n(15) 如果有人的工程被燒掉，他就將受到損失，而他自己卻將得救，但是會像從火裡經過的那樣。</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">「誰定這事並且作成？誰從起初預定萬代呢？就是我主，我是首先的，與最後的人同在的，也是我。」(以賽亞書 41:4)</p>\n<p>阿們，主耶穌基督萬能的王。</p>\n<p>保羅·科恩</p>\n<p>轉到我們的部分：<a
